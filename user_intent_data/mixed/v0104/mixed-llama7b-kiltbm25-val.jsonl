From there, the virus quickly spread to other parts of the world, including Europe, North America, and Asia.\nThe Spanish flu was particularly deadly because it affected young, healthy adults more than previous flu outbreaks had. The virus caused severe respiratory illness, including pneumonia and bronchitis, and was often fatal within days of onset. The mortality rate for the pandemic was estimated to be around 2.5% to 5%, which is much higher than the typical flu season mortality rate of around 0.1%.\nThe pandemic spread rapidly around the world, with cases reported in every continent except Antarctica. It is estimated that the virus killed between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in human history.\nThe Spanish flu pandemic had a significant impact on society, including the closure of schools, businesses, and public gatherings, and the implementation of strict quarantine measures. It also had a major impact on the war effort, as many countries were unable to mobilize their military forces due to the high number of sick and dying soldiers.\nThe pandemic finally subsided in the summer of 1919, although some areas continued to experience outbreaks until 1920. The exact cause of the Spanish flu is still not fully understood, but it is believed to have been a strain of the H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus.", "known": false}

Sun returned to China in 1894 and became involved in revolutionary activities aimed at overthrowing the Qing dynasty. He founded the Tongmenghui, a secret society dedicated to achieving Chinese independence, and became its leader.\nIn 1911, Sun led a series of protests and uprisings against the Qing government, which culminated in the Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911. This event marked the beginning of the end of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China. Sun was elected as the provisional president of the Republic of China in 1912, and he served in this position until his death in 1925.\nThe establishment of the Republic of China in 1912 marked a significant turning point in Chinese history, as it ended centuries of imperial rule and marked the beginning of a new era of modernization and political reform in China. However, the Republic of China was plagued by political instability, corruption, and conflict, including a civil war between the Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC), which led to the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.", "known": false}

The Supreme Court has established certain guidelines and restrictions on the use of the death penalty, including the requirement that juries must unanimously agree on the defendant's guilt and that the sentencing process must be fair and impartial.\nIf someone is sentenced to death, they will typically be sent to a state or federal prison where they will be held until their execution can be carried out. The exact process and timing of an execution varies depending on the state and the specific circumstances of the case. In the United States, there are currently 30 states that have the death penalty, and the federal government also has the power to impose the death penalty in certain cases.\nIt is important to note that the use of the death penalty is a complex and controversial issue, with many ethical, legal, and social implications.

Here are some possible effects:\n1. Ballistic trajectory: Bullets shot into the air will follow a ballistic trajectory, which means they will follow a curved path as they travel upwards and then fall back to the ground. The trajectory will depend on the initial velocity of the bullet, the angle of entry, and the air resistance it encounters.\n2. Range: The distance that a bullet travels before falling back to the ground depends on its initial velocity and the angle of entry. High-velocity bullets can travel long distances, while lower-velocity bullets will fall back to the ground more quickly.\n3. Fragmentation: When a bullet hits the air, it can break apart into smaller pieces due to the shock waves generated by the impact. This can happen if the bullet is designed to fragment or if it encounters air resistance and breaks apart.\n4. Ricochet: If a bullet is shot at a shallow angle into the air, it can ricochet off the ground or other surfaces before falling back to the ground. This can happen if the bullet is traveling fast enough to bounce off the surface it hits.\n5. Drop: As a bullet falls back to the ground, it will experience a drop due to gravity. The amount of drop will depend on the initial velocity of the bullet and the angle of entry.\n6. Penetration: If a bullet strikes a hard surface, such as the ground or a building, it can penetrate the surface and potentially cause damage. The amount of penetration will depend on the type of bullet and the material it strikes.\n7. Spread: As a bullet falls back to the ground, it can spread out due to air resistance, which can affect its accuracy. The amount of spread will depend on the type of bullet and the air density it encounters.\n8. Terminal velocity: When a bullet reaches the top of its trajectory, it will begin to slow down due to air resistance. Eventually, it will reach a terminal velocity, which is the maximum speed it can reach in a given environment.\n9.

The cause of the explosion is still debated among historians and experts, but there are several theories as to who was responsible:\n\n1. Spanish: The Spanish government was initially blamed for the explosion, as they had been involved in a long-standing conflict with the United States over Cuban independence. Some Americans believed that the Spanish had deliberately attacked the USS Maine as a provocation to draw the US into the conflict. However, subsequent investigations have cast doubt on this theory.\n2. Cuban rebels: Another theory is that the explosion was caused by a Cuban rebel group, who were fighting against Spanish rule in Cuba at the time. Some Cuban rebels had been known to use guerrilla tactics, including sabotage and terrorism, against Spanish forces.\n3. Internal explosion: Some experts believe that the explosion was caused by an internal malfunction or accident within the USS Maine itself. This theory suggests that the ship's magazines or powder rooms may have been poorly maintained or improperly stored, leading to a catastrophic explosion.\n4. Mining: Another theory is that the USS Maine was mined by the Spanish, either intentionally or accidentally. This theory is supported by the fact that the USS Maine was anchored in a location where Spanish mines were known to be present.\n5. Accidental coal fire: Some historians believe that the explosion was caused by an accidental coal fire that ignited the ship's magazines. The USS Maine was fueled by coal, and it is possible that a coal fire may have started in the ship's hold, leading to the explosion.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are several theories as to who was responsible for the explosion of the USS Maine, the exact cause of the disaster remains unknown.

Golden Gate Park was carved out of unpromising sand and shore dunes that were known as the Outside Lands, in an unincorporated area west of San Francisco's then-current borders. Conceived ostensibly for recreation, the underlying purpose of the park was housing development and the westward expansion of the city. The tireless field engineer William Hammond Hall prepared a survey and topographic map of the park site in 1870 and became its commissioner in 1871. He was later named California's first state engineer and developed an integrated flood control system for the Sacramento Valley.

In 1876, the plan was almost replaced by one for a racetrack, favored by \"the Big Four\" millionaires: Leland Stanford, Mark Hopkins, Collis P. Huntington, and Charles Crocker. Stanford, who was president of the Southern Pacific Railroad, was also one of the owners of the Ocean Railroad Company, which ran from Haight Street across the park to its south border, then out to the beach and north to a point near Cliff House. It was Gus Mooney who claimed land adjacent to the park on Ocean Beach. Many of Mooney's friends also staked claims and built shanties on the beach to sell refreshments to the patrons of the park. Hall resigned, and the remaining park commissioners followed. In 1882 Governor George C. Perkins appointed Frank M. Pixley, founder and editor of The Argonaut, to the board of commissioners of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Pixley was adamant that the Mooney's shanties be eliminated, and he found support with the San Francisco Police for park security. Pixley favored Stanford's company by granting a fifty-year lease on the route that closed the park on three sides to competition.

He worked as a gardener and landscape designer in various parks and gardens in the San Francisco Bay Area before being hired as the superintendent of Golden Gate Park in 1887.\nUnder McLaren's leadership, the park underwent a significant transformation. He oversaw the design and construction of many of the park's most notable features, including the Japanese Tea Garden, the Conservatory of Flowers, and the de Young Museum. He also developed the park's landscape architecture, creating a network of paths, roads, and gardens that were designed to provide a peaceful oasis in the midst of the bustling city.\nMcLaren was known for his innovative approach to landscape design, which emphasized the use of native plants and naturalistic landscaping techniques. He believed that the park should be a place where people could connect with nature and enjoy the beauty of the outdoors, and he worked tirelessly to create a space that would be both functional and aesthetically pleasing.\nThroughout his career, McLaren was recognized for his contributions to the field of landscape architecture. He was awarded the American Society of Landscape Architects' Gold Medal in 1930, and he was inducted into the California Hall of Fame in 2006.

Here is a brief overview of the development of the first mouse:\n1. Douglas Engelbart: Douglas Engelbart is widely recognized as the inventor of the computer mouse. He was a researcher and inventor who worked at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the 1960s. Engelbart's work on the mouse was part of a larger project to develop interactive computing technologies, including the development of the first graphical user interface (GUI).\n2. The first mouse prototype: Engelbart and his team developed the first mouse prototype in 1964. The early prototype was made of wood and had a single button that allowed users to move the cursor on the screen. The mouse was connected to the computer via a cable and used a mechanical system to track the user's movements.\n3. Xerox PARC: In 1970, Engelbart's team demonstrated their mouse-based interface to a group of researchers at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), who were interested in developing their own GUI technology. Xerox PARC's researchers were impressed with the mouse and its potential for improving human-computer interaction.\n4. Apple Computer: In 1979, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, co-founders of Apple Computer, visited Xerox PARC and saw the mouse in action. They were inspired by the mouse and its potential for improving the user experience of their upcoming personal computer, the Apple Lisa. Apple licensed the technology from Xerox and incorporated it into their Lisa and Macintosh computers, making the mouse a standard component of personal computers.\n5. Industry adoption: The mouse quickly became a standard component of personal computers, and its popularity grew rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, the mouse is an essential input device for most computers, laptops, and mobile devices.\nIn summary, the development of the first mouse was a collaborative effort between Douglas Engelbart and his team at SRI, followed by the adoption and improvement of the technology by Xerox PARC and Apple", "known": false}

Therefore, there are only 3 independent coordinates for the diatomic gas molecule.\n4. Calculate the number of degrees of freedom: The number of degrees of freedom for a diatomic gas molecule is equal to the number of independent coordinates minus the number of constraints.

At this time, England was the leading industrial power in the world, with a large and rapidly growing manufacturing sector.\nHowever, it's worth noting that the Industrial Revolution was a gradual process that took place over several centuries, and its impact varied across different regions and industries.

The British government wanted to create a more central location for the capital city, one that was closer to the center of the country and better connected to the rest of India. Delhi, which is located in the heart of northern India, was seen as a more suitable location for this purpose.\nIn 1911, the British government passed the Government of India Act, which officially established Delhi as the capital of India. The act also created a new federal system of government, with Delhi as the seat of the federal government.\nThe shift of the capital from Calcutta to Delhi was not without controversy, however. Many people in Calcutta and other parts of India felt that the city was being unfairly neglected and that the shift would have negative economic and cultural consequences.

Modern SMS text messaging is usually messaging from one mobile phone to another. Finnish Radiolinja became the first network to offer a commercial person-to-person SMS text messaging service in 1994.

Here are some of the key functions of the acrosome:\n1. Enzyme release: The acrosome contains a variety of enzymes, including hyaluronidase, acid phosphatase, and proteases, which are released upon activation of the sperm cell. These enzymes help to break down the tough outer layer of the egg cell (zona pellucida) and allow the sperm cell to penetrate and fertilize the egg.\n2. pH regulation: The acrosome also helps to regulate the pH of the environment around the sperm cell, which is important for fertilization. The acrosome contains an acidic pH, which helps to create an optimal environment for fertilization to occur.\n3. Signaling: The acrosome can also release signaling molecules, such as calcium ions and second messengers, which help to signal the sperm cell to undergo the necessary changes to fertilize the egg.\n4. Protection: The acrosome acts as a protective barrier for the sperm cell, shielding it from the hostile environment of the female reproductive tract and protecting it from immune cells that might try to attack it.\n5. Fusion: The acrosome also plays a role in the fusion of the sperm cell with the egg cell. After the sperm cell has penetrated the egg, the acrosome fuses with the egg cell membrane, allowing the sperm cell to deliver its genetic material to the egg.\nIn summary, the acrosome is a crucial structure in the sperm cell that plays a central role in fertilization by releasing enzymes, regulating pH, signaling, protecting the sperm cell, and facilitating fusion with the egg cell.", "known": false}

However, based on archaeological and genetic evidence, it is believed that dogs were domesticated from gray wolves around 15,000 to 30,000 years ago.\nThe earliest evidence of dog domestication comes from a site in what is now Germany, where archaeologists have found the remains of dogs that date back around 14,700 years. Similarly, in Russia, the remains of dogs have been found at a site dating back around 10,000 years.\nIt is believed that dogs were initially domesticated for their ability to provide food, such as hunting and gathering, rather than as pets. Over time, however, dogs evolved to become more closely tied to humans and were bred for various purposes, such as herding, guarding, and companionship.\nThe first recorded evidence of dogs being kept as pets dates back to around 4,000 years ago in ancient Egypt. In ancient Egyptian society, dogs were considered sacred animals and were often mummified and buried with their owners.\nIn other cultures, such as ancient China and ancient Greece, dogs were also kept as pets and were valued for their loyalty and companionship.\nOverall, while the exact date of when the first dog became a pet is not known, it is clear that dogs have been an important part of human society for thousands of years and have evolved over time to become the diverse and beloved companions we know today.", "known": false}

The war was fought primarily in North America, with battles taking place in what is now Canada, the United States, and the Caribbean.\nThe war ended with a decisive victory for the British. In 1763, the Treaty of Paris was signed, which recognized British control over most of North America east of the Mississippi River, including present-day Canada, the Great Lakes region, and the Ohio River Valley. The French ceded these territories to the British, and the Native American tribes lost their ally and were forced to negotiate separate treaties with the British.\nThe war had significant long-term consequences for the colonies in North America. The British government began to exert greater control over the colonies, imposing taxes and laws that the colonists resented. These tensions eventually led to the American Revolutionary War, which began in 1775 and ended with the Declaration of Independence in 1776.", "known": true}

The Ohio State Reformatory is a real prison that was built in 1896 and operated until 1990. It has since been converted into a tourist attraction and filming location.\n\nThe exterior shots of Shawshank Prison were filmed at the Ohio State Reformatory, while the interior scenes were filmed on a soundstage in Cleveland, Ohio. The prison's address is 100 Reformatory Road, Mansfield, OH 44903.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the movie is set in Maine, the filmmakers chose to shoot the movie in Ohio because of its similar architecture and atmosphere to the state of Maine. The Ohio State Reformatory has a distinctive look that resembles a classic American prison from the 1940s and 1950s, which was important for the film's aesthetic.", "known": true}

Here are some of the key actors and their levels of power during this period:\n1. Continental Congress: The Continental Congress was the governing body of the Articles of Confederation, consisting of representatives from each state. Congress had the power to make laws, declare war, and manage foreign affairs, but its authority was limited by the lack of a strong executive or judicial branch.\n2. State governments: Under the Articles of Confederation, state governments had significant autonomy and power. States could veto federal laws, and they were responsible for appointing senators and representatives to Congress.\n3. State legislatures: State legislatures played a crucial role in shaping state policy and influencing federal decisions. They had the power to elect state representatives to Congress and to ratify or reject federal laws.\n4. State executives: Each state had its own executive branch, which was responsible for enforcing state laws and policies. State executives, such as governors and lieutenant governors, played a significant role in state politics and often influenced federal policy.\n5. Local governments: Local governments, such as town and city councils, had significant power over local affairs, including taxation, law enforcement, and infrastructure development.\n6. Individual statesmen: Certain individuals, such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, held significant influence during the Articles of Confederation due to their leadership roles in the Revolutionary War and their continued involvement in national politics. However, their power was limited by the decentralized nature of the government under the Articles.\n7. Indian tribes: The Articles of Confederation recognized the sovereignty of Indian tribes and allowed them to maintain their independence within the framework of the federal government.\n8. British government: Although the British government no longer had direct control over the colonies under the Articles of Confederation, it still held significant influence over American affairs through its economic and cultural ties with the colonies.\n\nIn summary, the power structure under the Articles of Confederation was decentralized and fragmented among various actors, including state governments, state legislatures, state executives, local governments, individual statesmen, Indian tribes, and the British government.", "known": true}

During this period, the military and police were given sweeping powers to suppress dissent and opposition, and many civil liberties were suspended.\nThe lifting of martial law was a key event in the People Power Revolution, which led to Marcos' eventual ouster from power. On June 30, 1981, President Corazon Aquino, who had taken over as president after Marcos' ouster, issued Proclamation No. 2041, which formally lifted the martial law declaration.\nThe lifting of martial law marked a significant turning point in the country's history, as it paved the way for the return to democracy and the restoration of civil liberties. It also led to the establishment of the Commission on Human Rights, which was tasked with investigating and documenting human rights abuses committed during the martial law era.", "known": false}

Metals are made up of a single type of atom, with a specific number of protons in their atomic nucleus that defines their chemical element. For example, a copper atom has 29 protons in its nucleus, which makes it a copper atom.\nIn general, metals are made up of a large number of atoms that are arranged in a regular, repeating pattern called a crystal lattice. The atoms in the lattice are held together by strong electrostatic forces, known as metallic bonds, which are responsible for the metal's strength and ductility.\nIons, on the other hand, are atoms or groups of atoms that have gained or lost electrons to form a charged particle. Ions are typically found in ionic compounds, where they are arranged in a specific ratio to form a crystal lattice. Ionic compounds typically have a high melting point and are often soluble in water.\nWhile some metals can exhibit ionic properties, such as sodium chloride (NaCl), which is composed of sodium ions (Na+) and chloride ions (Cl-), pure metals are generally made up of neutral atoms rather than ions.\nIt's worth noting that the distinction between atoms and ions can be blurry, and there are some cases where atoms can exhibit ionic properties, such as in the case of some metal oxides, where the metal atoms can lose or gain electrons to form ions.
