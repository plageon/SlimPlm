Here are some possible reasons why a bigger bag of chips might contain zero trans fats while a smaller bag contains trans fats:\n\n1. Different types of oil: Larger bags of chips may be fried in a different type of oil that has a lower level of trans fats than the smaller bag. For example, some manufacturers may use a blend of vegetable oils that is naturally low in trans fats for their larger bags, while smaller bags may be fried in a blend that contains more trans fats.\n2. Batch size: The size of the batch of chips can also affect the amount of trans fats present. Larger batches may require more oil to fry, which can result in a higher concentration of trans fats. Smaller batches, on the other hand, may use less oil and therefore contain fewer trans fats.\n3. Manufacturing process: The way in which the chips are manufactured can also impact the amount of trans fats present. For example, some manufacturers may use a process called \"interesterification\" to reduce the amount of trans fats in their chips. This involves adding a small amount of a different type of fat to the oil before frying the chips, which can help to reduce the amount of trans fats. Larger bags of chips may be made using this process, while smaller bags may be made using a different method that results in more trans fats.\n4. Labeling and packaging: The labeling and packaging of chips can also play a role in the amount of trans fats present. Some manufacturers may choose to list the amount of trans fats on the label of their larger bags, while smaller bags may not have this information listed. This can make it difficult to determine the amount of trans fats in a smaller bag of chips without checking the ingredient list or contacting the manufacturer.\n\nIn summary, the amount of trans fats in a bag of chips can vary depending on several factors, including the type of oil used, the size of the batch, the manufacturing process, and the labeling and packaging of", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.15151515151515152, "rouge2": 0.0391304347826087, "rougeL": 0.0909090909090909, "rougeLsum": 0.12554112554112554}, "known": false}

This is because the human eye is not designed to focus on such intense light sources for extended periods of time. The pupil of the eye dilates to allow more light in, but this can also cause the eye to become overwhelmed and fatigued.\nIn contrast, when you watch a video of someone welding, the light and UV radiation are not directed directly at your eyes. The light source is coming from a distance, and the intensity of the light is reduced by the distance and any obstacles between you and the screen. As a result, the light does not have the same impact on your eyes as it would if you were looking directly at the welder.\nAdditionally, the way that light is processed by the human brain can also play a role in why watching a video of welding does not cause eye strain. When you watch a video, your brain processes the light and color information from the screen as a two-dimensional image, rather than as a direct light source. This can make it easier for your eyes to handle the light and color of the video without causing discomfort.\nIt's worth noting, however, that prolonged exposure to any bright light source, including watching videos of welding, can still cause eye strain and fatigue.

This can occur due to the brain's tendency to look for patterns and assign meaning to visual information.\nThere are several reasons why people may see faces in everything:\n1. Evolutionary advantage: Throughout human history, recognizing faces has been crucial for survival, as it helped early humans identify friends, family, and potential threats. As a result, our brains have become wired to quickly identify faces, even in trivial objects.\n2. Brain's face-detection system: The brain has a specialized system for detecting faces, which is highly developed in humans. This system is thought to be responsible for the tendency to see faces in unexpected places.\n3. Attention and expectations: People who are more attentive and expectant tend to see faces more frequently than those who are less attentive. For example, if someone is looking for faces in a crowd, they are more likely to notice them than someone who is not.\n4. Cultural influence: Our cultural background and upbringing can also play a role in seeing faces in everything. For instance, some cultures place a strong emphasis on the importance of faces and facial expressions, which can lead to a greater tendency to see faces in everyday objects.\n5. Psychological factors: Certain psychological factors, such as anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder, can also contribute to the tendency to see faces in everything.\nIt's important to note that seeing faces in everything is a common and harmless phenomenon, but it can sometimes be a sign of an underlying psychological issue. If you find yourself constantly seeing faces in objects or situations where there are none, it may be worth speaking with a mental health professional.", "known": true}

The active site is a small cleft or pocket on the surface of the enzyme that is shaped to fit the substrate. The substrate binds to the active site through non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrophobic forces.\nOnce the substrate binds to the active site, the enzyme can undergo a conformational change that allows the substrate to be positioned in the correct orientation for the reaction to occur. This conformational change can involve a rotation of the enzyme or a movement of the substrate relative to the enzyme.\nThe substrate then undergoes a chemical reaction with the enzyme, resulting in the formation of a product. The product is released from the enzyme, and the enzyme is free to repeat the reaction with another substrate.\nIn summary, the substrate fits into the active site of the enzyme, where it binds through non-covalent interactions and undergoes a chemical reaction with the enzyme to form a product.

They are made up of a protein coat that surrounds a strand of genetic material, either DNA or RNA. Viruses are not considered living organisms because they are unable to reproduce on their own and require a host cell to replicate.\nViruses exist for several reasons:\n1. Evolutionary advantage: Viruses have evolved as a way for their hosts to defend themselves against other pathogens. By infecting and replicating within other microorganisms, viruses can help to regulate the population of these organisms and maintain a balance in the ecosystem.\n2. Diversity of life: Viruses play a crucial role in shaping the diversity of life on Earth. By infecting and altering the genetic material of their hosts, viruses can drive evolutionary changes that lead to the emergence of new species.\n3. Gene transfer: Viruses can transfer genetic material between different organisms, allowing them to acquire new traits and adapt to changing environments. This process of gene transfer is thought to have played a key role in the evolution of many organisms, including humans.\n4. Immune system evasion: Viruses have evolved complex strategies to evade the immune systems of their hosts. By hiding from or manipulating the immune system, viruses can continue to replicate and cause disease.\n5. Economic importance: Viruses are used in various industries, such as agriculture, biotechnology, and medicine. For example, viruses are used in vaccine development to introduce genetic material into cells, and they are also used in gene therapy to deliver therapeutic genes to specific cells.\n6. Biological warfare: Viruses have been used as biological weapons, and they have the potential to be used as weapons of mass destruction.\n7. Ecological importance: Viruses play a crucial role in shaping the balance of ecosystems.

Here are the details of the discovery:\n1. Location: The Titanic wreck was found in the North Atlantic Ocean, approximately 370 miles (600 kilometers) southeast of the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. The wreck is located at a depth of about 12,500 feet (3,800 meters) below the surface of the ocean.\n2. Discovery method: The team used a combination of sonar and submersible vehicles to locate and explore the wreck. They used a specialized sonar system called a side-scan sonar to detect the wreck's outline, and then used a submersible called the Alvin to confirm the identity of the wreck and gather detailed images and samples.\n3. Timing: The Titanic was discovered on September 1, 1985, exactly 73 years after it sank on April 15, 1912. The discovery was announced to the public on September 8, 1985.\n4. Significance: The discovery of the Titanic wreck was a significant moment in history, as it provided new insights into the ship's fate and helped to solve some of the mysteries surrounding its sinking. It also sparked renewed interest in the Titanic and its crew and passengers, and has been the subject of numerous documentaries, books, and other works of art and media.", "known": true}

Here are some of the potential effects:\n1. Massive Impact Cratering: The impact would create a massive crater, likely measuring hundreds or even thousands of kilometers in diameter. The crater would be so large that it would alter the Earth's rotation and tilt, potentially causing severe climate disruptions and tidal waves.\n2. Global Firestorms: The impact would release an enormous amount of energy, igniting massive firestorms across the planet. These fires would be fueled by the impact's heat and the resulting atmospheric disturbances, and could burn for weeks or even months, releasing vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n3. Atmospheric Disturbances: The impact would also create massive atmospheric disturbances, including shockwaves, hurricane-force winds, and massive dust storms. These disturbances would spread across the globe, causing widespread destruction and disrupting weather patterns.\n4. Tsunamis and Sea Level Rise: The impact would generate massive tsunamis, with waves reaching as high as 100 meters or more. These tsunamis would affect coastal areas around the world, causing widespread flooding and devastation. Additionally, the impact would cause sea levels to rise by tens of meters, flooding low-lying areas and displacing millions of people.\n5. Earthquakes and Tectonic Activity: The impact would also trigger massive earthquakes and tectonic activity, as the shockwave from the impact would disrupt the Earth's crust and cause seismic activity. This could lead to widespread destruction and loss of life in affected areas.\n6. Global Cooling: After the initial impact, the Earth would experience a prolonged period of global cooling due to the injection of large amounts of dust and debris into the stratosphere. This would lead to a significant decrease in global temperatures, potentially causing widespread crop failures and disruptions to food supplies.\n7. Extinction Event: The impact would likely lead to a mass extinction event, with many species of plants and animals becoming extinct.

{"id": "rpikz", "output": [{"answer": "Well, OSes like most software has evolved over time. They started out very simply and over time more and more features got added. Eventually they get to a point where all the new features make the system run too slowly, so that is when they do a larger rewrite, and they may redesign most of the OS from the ground up or they may use pieces from the last version. For example, between Windows XP and Win 7, there has been large rewrites to most of the operating system, but between Windows Vista and Windows 7, they reused some portions of Vista. \n\nIf you are wondering how people go about designing and building a new OS, then you have to understand what an OS does and how it interacts with the rest of the computer system. It's pretty hard to describe it ELI5, as OSes are a pretty advanced topic. I'll try to explain some of it and not get too long winded about it. \n\n***How are operating systems coded?***\n\nLike most software, an OS is written in source code by programmers and software engineers. The source code is broken down into many files, so that small pieces of the system can be written separately. The source code is then run through a Compiler, which turns it into a machine readable format and is then packaged into an installer application. The installer is responsible for putting all of the compiled code in the correct locations in memory so that the OS can start. \n\n***How does an operating system start up on a computer?***\n\nWhen you first turn your computer on, its a pretty dumb machine, its built so it will be able to start with a minimum of hardware attached. The first part that controls your computer is the firmware, often called a BIOS (Basic Input Output System). The BIOS is responsible for making sure all of the necessary pieces are plugged in (processor, RAM memory, hard drive, and the many components built into the motherboard), and it is also responsible for displaying the basic start up info on your monitor and taking input from your keyboard in case you want to go into the BIOS setup (or setup for some other component). The BIOS assigns Addresses/Names to all the components in your computer, it is basically making a map of all of your hardware, later the BIOS will give this map of hardware to the OS so that the OS will know how to access and use all the different components. All of this start up stuff is programmed into the flash memory of the BIOS chip on your motherboard, it's stored on the motherboard and not on a hard drive or in the RAM because all of these other memory locations might be removed from the computer, the basic function of turning on is stored on the motherboard since without that your computer has no backbone and can't function anyways. After the BIOS is done setting up, it has a setting stored in it (that you can change) that tells it where to look for an operating system, it might first look for any USB drives, then CD/DVD, and then a list of hard drives to check (since your computer might have more than one hard drive). If it looks on a hard drive, it looks in a part of the drive called the Boot Sector, which is an area set aside for booting OSes. In the Boot Sector (which is setup by the OS installer) there will be a pointer telling the computer where the actual Boot Loader is for the operating system. So once your BIOS finds the right Boot Sector, it learns where the Boot Loader is for Win 7 (or whatever OS you have). The Boot Loader is a special program that starts the OS, it takes the hardware map from the BIOS and turns it into something the OS can use, it also handles the loading of the Kernel and anything that needs to be in RAM for the OS to start. Once the Boot Loader is done, everything is setup, turned on, and running on your computer how the OS expects it to be, so the Boot Loader passes control over to the OS Kernel and you are displayed your login prompt. \n\n***What does an operating system do?***\n\nThe OS is the main backbone program that runs on your computer. It's job is to be the boss of all the other programs you want to run. In order to have many programs running at the same time, it is important to manage what each program is allowed to do and when it is allowed to do it. The OS is responsible for assigning RAM to programs to use, when more RAM is in use than you have physically in your system, the OS is responsible for moving some of the data in RAM into a cache on the Hard drive (called swap space, or a page file). This allows more programs to be running then could fit in the physical memory for your computer. Your computer probably has multiple processing cores, each core can also handle running multiple things at the same time by switching between tasks very quickly, overall processors are very complex and it is the OSes responsibility to manage what program is running where, how long it gets to use the processor and what sorts of things it is allowed to do with the processor. So from your programs perspective, the OS gives it memory when it needs it, schedules it to run on the processor (without the program knowing about it), gives it access to the display for showing graphics, to the sound system for playing sounds, and whenever you touch your keyboard/mouse/gamepad the OS sends signals to the programs/games that are interested so that they know the buttons have been pushed. From the user's perspective (yours) the OS is where you start all of your other programs/games, its how you end programs that aren't stopping on their own, and how you switch between programs since you probably want to use more than one at a time. The OS is also responsible for a lot of security things, it makes sure that programs aren't messing around with the memory that is assigned to other programs (a lot of old hacks/viruses did this), it also allows you to limit which programs can access certain parts of your hard drive, or send information over the internet connection, and the OS tries to make it so that only the programs you choose to install get installed (although malware still likes to sneak in). \n\nSo, to answer your question about how OSes are created...

Here is a general overview of the steps involved in creating an operating system:\n1. Planning and design: The first step in creating an operating system is to define its goals, objectives, and architecture. This involves identifying the type of hardware the OS will run on, the type of applications it will support, and the level of performance and security required.\n2. System call specification: An operating system must define a set of system calls, which are functions that applications can use to request services from the OS. These system calls may include tasks such as process scheduling, memory management, and file management.\n3. Kernel development: The kernel is the core component of an operating system that manages hardware resources and provides services to applications. The kernel must be designed and implemented, including the development of device drivers, file systems, and other essential components.\n4. User space development: In addition to the kernel, an operating system must also provide a user space environment for applications to run in. This includes developing libraries, utilities, and other tools that applications can use.\n5. Testing and debugging: Once the OS has been developed, it must be thoroughly tested and debugged to ensure that it is reliable and performs well. This may involve testing the OS on different hardware configurations and with various types of applications.\n6. Documentation and maintenance: Finally, the OS must be documented and maintained over time to ensure that it continues to function correctly and remains secure. This may involve updating the OS to support new hardware or software technologies, as well as fixing bugs and security vulnerabilities.\nHere are some additional details on each of these steps:\n1. Planning and design:\n* Define the goals and objectives of the OS, including the type of hardware it will run on, the type of applications it will support, and the level of performance and security required.\n* Identify the key components of the OS, such as the kernel, device drivers, and file systems.\n* Develop a high-level design for the OS, including the overall architecture and the relationships between the different components.\n2.

If you survive a crazy fall like that it's because you got insanely lucky with tree branches or something. \n\nHumans can't survive a fall like that, it's physics."], "llama7b_without_search_answer": " The ability of a human to survive a fall depends on several factors, including the height of the fall, the surface they land on, and their overall physical condition. Here are some reasons why some people can survive falls from great heights while others do not:\n1. Body position: If a person falls from a height and lands on their back or stomach, they are more likely to survive than if they land on their head or chest. This is because the body can absorb the impact of the fall better when it lands on these areas rather than the head or chest.\n2. Airbag effect: If a person is wearing a seatbelt or an airbag deploys during a car crash, it can help cushion the impact of the fall and reduce the risk of injury or death. Similarly, if a person falls from a great height and lands on a soft surface, such as grass or water, they may be able to survive the fall.\n3. Skill and training: People who are trained in falling or have experience with high-risk activities, such as skydiving or rock climbing, may be able to survive falls from greater heights than those who are not trained or experienced. This is because they know how to position their body to minimize the impact of the fall and how to use their equipment to break their fall.\n4. Physical condition: A person's overall physical fitness and health can also play a role in their ability to survive a fall. For example, someone who is in good physical shape may be able to withstand the forces of a fall better than someone who is not as physically fit.\n5. Luck: Sometimes, even with all the right precautions and training, accidents can still happen. In these cases, luck can play a role in whether or not a person survives a fall. For example, if a person falls from a great height and lands on a soft surface, they may be able to survive even if they are not in the best physical condition.\n6. Medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as a bleeding disorder or a spinal injury, can increase the risk of death or serious injury from a fall. In these cases, even a relatively short fall can be fatal.\n7. Surface: The surface that a person lands on can also affect their ability to survive a fall.

The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons, which are collectively known as nucleons. These nucleons are packed together in a very small space, resulting in a high density compared to the rest of the atom.\nThe density of an atom is typically measured in units of mass per unit volume, such as grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³). The density of an atom is typically on the order of 10^-24 to 10^-22 g/cm³, which means that a very small amount of mass is concentrated in a very small volume.\nIn comparison, the density of a typical atom is about 1/100,000th the density of water, which means that if you were to fill a container with atoms, it would be able to float on top of a layer of water without sinking.\nIt's worth noting that the density of an atom can vary depending on the element and the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. For example, hydrogen has a much lower density than most other elements because it has only one proton in its nucleus, while heavier elements like uranium have a much higher density due to their larger nuclei.", "known": true}

Cost: Repaving an overpass can be more expensive than repaving a regular road section due to the complexity of the structure and the need for specialized equipment. By skipping the overpass, the cost of the project can be reduced.\n2. Limited access: Overpasses often have limited access points, making it difficult for construction crews to reach the area. This can make it challenging to complete the repaving work safely and efficiently.\n3. Structural concerns: Some overpasses may have structural issues that need to be addressed before repaving can occur. For example, the deck may be damaged or the supports may need to be reinforced. In these cases, it may be safer and more cost-effective to address these issues before repaving the overpass.\n4. Traffic considerations: Overpasses are often busy areas with high volumes of traffic. Construction crews may choose to skip repaving an overpass during peak traffic hours to minimize delays and traffic congestion.\n5. Prioritization of needs: Road crews may prioritize repaving other areas of the road network that are in more urgent need of repair. For example, they may focus on repaving areas with potholes or other safety hazards that need immediate attention.\n6. Lack of access: In some cases, the overpass may not have adequate access points for construction crews to enter and complete the repaving work.\n7. Environmental concerns: Some overpasses may have environmental concerns such as endangered species or protected habitats that need to be taken into consideration during the repaving process.\n8.

It's much more expensive and has many more issues involved that the average Joe wanting to lose that extra twenty.

At this point, the best thing for them to do is gradually introduce controlled exercise into their lives.", "meta": {"score": 342}}, {"answer": "This is actually a part of my job and I have several clients I'm working with at the moment as I get to argue on their behalf to the doctors and insurance companies who want to deny the equipment or tell the obese person to get up and walk.\n\nSo to start, lets face it, they didn't get obese by making healthy decisions regarding their diet and exercise.  They have poor joints, secondary conditions, and a walk to the fridge would result in a 911 call.  When I am presented with a mobility evaluation I am to consider manual wheelchair, scooter, and power wheelchair.  I am to consider proper seating and how the mobility device will be used.  I am to consider possible weight gain.  I am not to consider what is possible if they lose 50% of their body weight.  That is a change in medical condition, and while I am to plan for the worst(10-15 percent weight gain), planning for weight loss tends to bite you in the end.\n\n_URL_0_  This is one company I use.  I do not represent them, but I sell their product privately.  You will notice here the difference between a power wheelchair and a scooter.\n\nSo from the start I will tell you that most actual scooters are private pay, especially for the morbidly obese.  Medicare states that these devices are for in home use only (despite what the scooter store showed).  Many insurances follow this, but even if they don't, a scooter that can handle an obese client is so large that it is hard to get around indoors, hard to transport, and hard to get through standard doorways.  This means scooters are almost always out during an obese evaluation, unless they want to pay cash and use it outdoors.  In this case, they tend to use it as a car.  Remember, a lot of the morbidly obese who qualify will not have a license to drive so they depend on these for transportation (which is wrong, but thats a different story)\n\nSo we get down to a decision based on manual versus power wheelchair.  Most of the time when the morbid obesity is the main cause of their health problem, a doctor will only write a prescription for a manual wheelchair because they want them to get exercise.  That is fine, but let us not pretend these people are going to exercise with their chair.  For up to 450 pound capacity  you add 7.5 inches to the seat width to get overall width of the chair.  For 600 pound you add 8.5 to nine inches.  So for a 600 pound manual wheelchair in say 24\" wide you are at 32.5 inches wide.  A 36\" doorway will only have approximately 33\" of available width as the door hinges inside of it.  So you see that anything over 24\" wide is impossible to fit through most ADA doorways.  This chair will also weigh in the neighborhood of 120-130 pounds.  When it folds it will be 16\"to 24\" wide. These numbers mean that is impossible for a caregiver or client to easily throw it in the trunk, which is a big advantage over power chairs.  It also means that a say 400 pound client now weighs 500 plus in a manual chair and must propel that \"functionally.\" That's a lot to roll or push!  Functional means they can get around their environment enough to complete their activities of daily living; eating, dressing, bathing, etc. You can see where most fail this test, as it's not easy wheeling that much weight around.\n\nSo we move on to power wheelchairs.  The benefit here is that the base size doesn't change.  The 600 pound capacity base I use has a max width of 28\".  This means that the seat and/or client are now the widest part of the chair.  So you can sit a 28\" seat on top of a power base, and it's still not as wide as a 24\" seat on a manual chair, while being small enough to fit through most doorways.  You also gain the benefit of the client being able to actual get around with it.  The downsides include cost, and the fact that that same base with average seating is about 350 pounds, so that 400 pound person now weighs 750 pounds, which can exceed many consumer level vehicle lifts. (again, different problem, but a consideration)\n\nNow, when I say seating, I mean the actual seating surfaces.  It can be as simple as a captain seat, which looks like a car seat or boat seat with manual recline and vinyl. It can be custom like a manual wheelchair with a pan and cushion.  The options are really crazy.  You can imagine that obese people are prone to skin problems.  These problems come from heat, moisture, pressure, and friction.  So yes, you can cram an obese person into a 24\" seat, but if their redundant tissue (fat) is rubbing somewhere wrong, it will break down and cause a sore.  Now add in poor hygiene (stereotype but common) and sensitivity issues and you can get a costly wound.  \n\nThis need for proper seating and the problem with width are what tend to push bariatric clients to power wheelchairs. \n\nAs for making it worse?  Do you really think they are going to wheel their manual chair miles a day and lose 100 pounds this year? Nope.  It's so heavy that they sit in one spot all day.  Proper mobility can go either way.  I do see some that use a power wheelchair to get out, improve their attitude (remember these people are generally trapped inside most of the time ((similar to say, most reditors)) (((burn)))) and actually start making positive choices due to the socialization.  I see some that use them and never get up and gain weight, but honestly,most stay about the same weight regardless of mobility device, especially if they've been obese a while.  This is just based on my experience, but I've discussed it with colleagues and that is our industry consensus.  \n\nWhy the doctors and insurance think that a mobility device should be an exercise device, I will never understand.  Perhaps they should prescribe a trainer or therapist to work with them (good ones do!).  Perhaps they should work with a dietician (the good ones do) or consider bariatric surgeries.  The bottom line is that it doesn't make the problem worse because it isn't the cause, nor the solution to the problem.  It solves a different problem and when misused or judged by outsiders it appears to cause it, but it does not.  Remember, the diagnosis comes before the chair.\n\nTL:DR  Manual chairs become too wide and heavy to work, power wheelchairs provide proper seating and mobility in a less wide package.  Neither are the answer to obesity.  Focus on proper exercise and diet are so they don't make the problem worse, they simply don't improve it.\n\nHope that makes sense.", "meta": {"score": 117}}, {"answer": "If the only reason they're obese is a decision not to exercise, then yes.  \n\nBut, if they are obese because of another disability that causes obesity directly (by which I mean impact the metabolism making it easier to gain or harder to lose weight) or because they've gained weight because they are generally less mobile (and so would have to use the scooter whether they were heavy or not), then no, it would not make the problem worse.\n\nEDIT: and, I would note that, even for the first group, lack of access to the scooter may well not help with the problem.  Very few health problems, even when they involve personal lack of will power, are helped when people can't interact with the rest of society.

A severely obese person is going to likely have sclerotic arteries, and be chronically short of breath. \n\nA person big and \"crippled\" enough to use a mobility scooter will need to diet and exercise with the help and supervision of a medical professional. It's much more expensive and has many more issues involved that the average Joe wanting to lose that extra twenty.

People who are that heavy also tend to not have the musculature in their lower body to compensate. As a result, it is difficult for morbidly obese people to stand or walk for too long. At this point, the best thing for them to do is gradually introduce controlled exercise into their lives.", "This is actually a part of my job and I have several clients I'm working with at the moment as I get to argue on their behalf to the doctors and insurance companies who want to deny the equipment or tell the obese person to get up and walk.\n\nSo to start, lets face it, they didn't get obese by making healthy decisions regarding their diet and exercise.  They have poor joints, secondary conditions, and a walk to the fridge would result in a 911 call.  When I am presented with a mobility evaluation I am to consider manual wheelchair, scooter, and power wheelchair.  I am to consider proper seating and how the mobility device will be used.  I am to consider possible weight gain.  I am not to consider what is possible if they lose 50% of their body weight.  That is a change in medical condition, and while I am to plan for the worst(10-15 percent weight gain), planning for weight loss tends to bite you in the end.\n\n_URL_0_  This is one company I use.  I do not represent them, but I sell their product privately.  You will notice here the difference between a power wheelchair and a scooter.\n\nSo from the start I will tell you that most actual scooters are private pay, especially for the morbidly obese.  Medicare states that these devices are for in home use only (despite what the scooter store showed).  Many insurances follow this, but even if they don't, a scooter that can handle an obese client is so large that it is hard to get around indoors, hard to transport, and hard to get through standard doorways.  This means scooters are almost always out during an obese evaluation, unless they want to pay cash and use it outdoors.  In this case, they tend to use it as a car.  Remember, a lot of the morbidly obese who qualify will not have a license to drive so they depend on these for transportation (which is wrong, but thats a different story)\n\nSo we get down to a decision based on manual versus power wheelchair.  Most of the time when the morbid obesity is the main cause of their health problem, a doctor will only write a prescription for a manual wheelchair because they want them to get exercise.  That is fine, but let us not pretend these people are going to exercise with their chair.  For up to 450 pound capacity  you add 7.5 inches to the seat width to get overall width of the chair.  For 600 pound you add 8.5 to nine inches.  So for a 600 pound manual wheelchair in say 24\" wide you are at 32.5 inches wide.  A 36\" doorway will only have approximately 33\" of available width as the door hinges inside of it.  So you see that anything over 24\" wide is impossible to fit through most ADA doorways.  This chair will also weigh in the neighborhood of 120-130 pounds.  When it folds it will be 16\"to 24\" wide. These numbers mean that is impossible for a caregiver or client to easily throw it in the trunk, which is a big advantage over power chairs.  It also means that a say 400 pound client now weighs 500 plus in a manual chair and must propel that \"functionally.\" That's a lot to roll or push!  Functional means they can get around their environment enough to complete their activities of daily living; eating, dressing, bathing, etc. You can see where most fail this test, as it's not easy wheeling that much weight around.\n\nSo we move on to power wheelchairs.  The benefit here is that the base size doesn't change.  The 600 pound capacity base I use has a max width of 28\".  This means that the seat and/or client are now the widest part of the chair.  So you can sit a 28\" seat on top of a power base, and it's still not as wide as a 24\" seat on a manual chair, while being small enough to fit through most doorways.  You also gain the benefit of the client being able to actual get around with it.  The downsides include cost, and the fact that that same base with average seating is about 350 pounds, so that 400 pound person now weighs 750 pounds, which can exceed many consumer level vehicle lifts. (again, different problem, but a consideration)\n\nNow, when I say seating, I mean the actual seating surfaces.  It can be as simple as a captain seat, which looks like a car seat or boat seat with manual recline and vinyl. It can be custom like a manual wheelchair with a pan and cushion.  The options are really crazy.  You can imagine that obese people are prone to skin problems.  These problems come from heat, moisture, pressure, and friction.  So yes, you can cram an obese person into a 24\" seat, but if their redundant tissue (fat) is rubbing somewhere wrong, it will break down and cause a sore.  Now add in poor hygiene (stereotype but common) and sensitivity issues and you can get a costly wound.  \n\nThis need for proper seating and the problem with width are what tend to push bariatric clients to power wheelchairs. \n\nAs for making it worse?  Do you really think they are going to wheel their manual chair miles a day and lose 100 pounds this year? Nope.  It's so heavy that they sit in one spot all day.  Proper mobility can go either way.  I do see some that use a power wheelchair to get out, improve their attitude (remember these people are generally trapped inside most of the time ((similar to say, most reditors)) (((burn)))) and actually start making positive choices due to the socialization.  I see some that use them and never get up and gain weight, but honestly,most stay about the same weight regardless of mobility device, especially if they've been obese a while.  This is just based on my experience, but I've discussed it with colleagues and that is our industry consensus.  \n\nWhy the doctors and insurance think that a mobility device should be an exercise device, I will never understand.  Perhaps they should prescribe a trainer or therapist to work with them (good ones do!).  Perhaps they should work with a dietician (the good ones do) or consider bariatric surgeries.  The bottom line is that it doesn't make the problem worse because it isn't the cause, nor the solution to the problem.  It solves a different problem and when misused or judged by outsiders it appears to cause it, but it does not.  Remember, the diagnosis comes before the chair.\n\nTL:DR  Manual chairs become too wide and heavy to work, power wheelchairs provide proper seating and mobility in a less wide package.  Neither are the answer to obesity.  Focus on proper exercise and diet are so they don't make the problem worse, they simply don't improve it.\n\nHope that makes sense.", "If the only reason they're obese is a decision not to exercise, then yes.  \n\nBut, if they are obese because of another disability that causes obesity directly (by which I mean impact the metabolism making it easier to gain or harder to lose weight) or because they've gained weight because they are generally less mobile (and so would have to use the scooter whether they were heavy or not), then no, it would not make the problem worse.\n\nEDIT: and, I would note that, even for the first group, lack of access to the scooter may well not help with the problem.  Very few health problems, even when they involve personal lack of will power, are helped when people can't interact with the rest of society.  The shame and difficulties of not being able to get around might incentivize some people to eat less, but it also might drive some people to eat more.", "I just came into this thread and just woke up and usually avoid these threads so bear with me.\nI am very obese right now and have to use a scooter I have Lower Leg Lymphedema and most of the weight is in my Legs this makes me very unbalanced.\nThink about most of your weight being in your legs and walking-I have compared it to the old weeble wobble toys.

Giving them mobility scooters at least allows some freedom.\n\nFrom a morbidly obese mans point of view (420 pounds at my heaviest), a scooter would have been a godsend.  However, being so young (28 now) made me feel ashamed for wanting to be \"lazy\".  I've been taking steps to lose weight, but it is not easy.  Everyone (myself included) looks at obese people and thinks \"What a slob! They must be so lazy!\"  But this is not always true.  I played football, soccer, baseball and wrestling in school.  I worked full time and attended college full time for 4 years with a 3.63 gpa.  I even found time to fit in a gym visit or two a week.  But I was still overweight.  I attribute it largely to the availability of high sugar, high carb quick 'n' easy foods and drinks, and the disproportionate costs between healthy foods and junky foods.  So before you go hating on a fat person, try walking up 5 steps in their shoes.\n\nTL;DR: Yes, mobility scooters can, ineffect make obesity worse.  However, being obese is not easy on the body and eventually there is no other option.", "I am a fat guy, but I have P.O.T.S. which means I can not stand very long without passing out. I also have counteractive heart problems (not related to weight) that the treatment makes the pots worse. I should use a scooter at a store, but I get self concious that people will judge that I use it because I'm fat, so instead I go in almost pass out and my wife checks out. I also get judgement about my handicap placard. Just because you can't see a medical condition doesn't mean it is not there. I've been SLOWLY losing weight since I can't really exercise though.", "As a former 300+ pound man, I can tell you the only thing I was better at than eating,was making excuses. The things I hear big people say are barriers are merely obstacles. I hate to break it to you, but you will feel hungry when losing weight, it is natural. In the last year I have quit smoking,drinking,and lost nearly 100 lbs. It is all about willpower, and most people lack it.", "please stop writing about the no-return point like a trip from 125 pounds to 700 is 2 days of bigmacs. if im off, call me out, but lying to a bunch of black and white text on a screen in front of you is silly.", "Some morbidly obese people get that way because they have an underlying illness that makes it hard for them to move around; the immobility then causes obesity.  The mobility scooter is for the underlying illness, not the obesity.", "The scooters original intent was for mobility impared elderly, eg grandma with parkinsons.  The earlier models seen in stores were **much** smaller and lighter.  Before scooters larger stores would often have a wheelchair available.", "And whats with all these people in wheelchairs? I mean,. you are never going to regain use of your legs if you wheel yourself around all day!", "It's rarely a direct \"formerly 'healthy' person eats 100 hamburgers a day until they need a scooter\" thing.\n\nFirst, just because they're obese and on a scooter, *it doesn't mean they're on the scooter because they're obese.* Perhaps they lost their ability to walk, and then became overweight as a result of that. Not that difficult to imagine.\n\nObviously it's sometimes possible to maintain great physical fitness even if you don't have the full use of your lower body. But certainly, it's much harder. And if somebody has lost use of their lower body it's possible that they have other health issues that make it even more difficult to exercise. Or maybe their legs function fine, but respiratory problems or heart problems prevent them from exercising.\n\nRedditors in more enlightened countries may also want to consider that obesity can be highly influenced by economic class in America. Many poorer people live in \"food deserts\" where there are a lack of markets selling fresh food. (How responsibly would *you* eat, if the closest supermarket was ten miles away and located in a town in which you couldn't afford to live?)\n_URL_1_\n\nImagine trying to keep physically fit while you have limited use of your lower body (or have crippling respiratory issues, or some other such thing) and don't even have access to fresh, healthy foods and are dealing with other health problems. Possible? Yes, but difficult, and not everybody in that situation is going to pull it off.", "This is something I have struggled a lot with. I am fairly young (38) and I don't go places where I would have to walk a lot because I would be in too much pain. So, my spouse encourages me to go and use scooters that are available but I won't because I know people will judge me because I am obese so they assume I'm just lazy. When you look at me you do not see the severe psoriatic arthritis that has attacked my bones and joints or the fibromyalgia that has made my nervous system a war zone with itself. All people see is the fat. I have a recumbent bike at home that I exercise on the days when it isn't as bad. Oh, we can't forget the side effects from all the medications I have to take that cause weight gain too.", "Downward spiral.  \n\n* Physical/Mental issue. \n* Can't/won't exercise.  \n* Comfort eat.  \n* Get in to a condition where it's long term goals and depressing to lose weight. \n* Get in to a condition where it's physically difficult to lose weight, \n* get more depressed gain more weight.  \n\nWithout the mobility, they'd just become more sedentary, less likely to get out and possibly head toward being bedridden.  \n\nGetting out gives one the chance to want to dig themselves out of the ditch bad enough to suffer through undoing the weight.", "From what I have experienced, and that is mostly from working on accessibility issues for public buildings, these scooters are usually sold to people who are already suffering from some sort of handicap, and the morbid obesity tends to follow once all they do to move around is manipulate a little joystick.", "Well, if the problem is that they can't fucking walk, then no.", "Yes, moving around on a scooter instead of walking does make the problem worse.\n\n99% of the people who are obese and on a scooter have a knee injury or bad knees.\n\nThey have this paradoxical problem in which they need a knee replacement surgery, but would ruin their new knees immediately upon walking on them... because they weigh so much.\n\nMost of weight loss is dietary.  So presumably a person who is mobidly obese could lose weight while on a scooter.  The actual amount of exercise that someone who is over 300 lbs needs to do to lose weight is really tiny.\n\nMy wife's father (before his knee replacement surgery) was over 400 lbs and sat in his recliner all day.  His wife forced him to get a waist band surgery to limit his in take of food (very extreme dieting).\n\nOnce a day as his exercise he would load the dishwasher... that's it.\n\nAfter a month or two of that his nutritionist advised him to walk in front of a Walmart 3 times every day after he got his morning Tim Horton's\n\nAfter five months it was moved up to 6 times.\n\nAfter a year he had to walk the dog around the block.\n\nAfter a year you're looking at roughly 100 lbs of weight loss and after three years of this he was finally under 300 lbs and finally able to get a knee replacement surgery.\n\nAt no point did he ever have a scooter, but whenever he would have gone on cruises or hotels he'd be wheeled around in a very large wheel chair.  It's a progressive system.\n\nTo give you an idea of how bad it sucks to be overweight and have no knees one day he slipped on a patch of ice on his way to the truck to pick up Tim Horton's.  He literally could not lift himself up.  He was behind the truck on the road and no one noticed.  He was out there freezing for a full hour when I showed up in my car.  Me and the Canada Post guy with an MMA fighter behind him supporting his weight lifted him up and got him back in the house.  I'm guessing had we not shown up he would have been suffering from some extreme frost bite.", "Yes it makes the problem worse, sorry if I upset a few people but there are quite a few 'Oh they need these scooters to aid their daily lives' type posts.\n\nFuck me it's completely delusional. These people have eaten their way into a ridiculous state. Alright, I accept that people can struggle with their weight etc but I live in Ireland which is a very Americanized place by any account. We have all your fast food outlets and soft drinks but guess what, even the fattest person I've ever seen in my country was not on a mobility scooter.\n\nI've been to the states many times and the impression I got of these people on mobility scooters was that of Homer wearing the 'Moo Moo' in the episode he intentionally gained weight. Basically, it seems to be a socially acceptable condition and scooters are the only solution when in fact it just allows these people to eat themselves into an early grave.\n\nYeh, a small percentage may genuinely need a scooter but very small in my opinion. America is leading the way in obesity and you're charging there on mobility scooters.", "Mobility scooters aren't just for obese folks. Its just very fun to take mocking pictures of morbidly obese folks in those scooters. \n\nThe elderly, the lame and the injured all use those scooters. Like, I have nerve damage in my right foot, from a very bad sprain. Sometimes, I need to go grocery shopping, at the same time where its painful to walk and my mobility with my right food is greatly reduce. \n\nAnd then we have my wonderful significant other. She was a nuclear technician on the USS Enterprise.  She has PTSD, nerve damage and host of other wonderful things that are small but add up to be a bitch. Sometimes, walking sucks. Sometimes this also happens when you need to go the store.\n\nThat scooter is awesome.", "A common flaw in thinking is that fat people are given scooters because they're fat.\n\nThat's not what's going on.\n\nPeople riding these scooters have an underlying medical condition which requires the device to get around, their lack of mobility then results in them becoming overweight.\n\nRight now I use scooters and stuff to get around and, yes, I'm overweight. The reason for the scooter is my right foot is having major issues and if I put weight on it I could lose the foot.\n\nFortunately it's also bound up in a huge fiberglass cast which helps cut down the dirty stare factor.", "Being unable to walk due to your obesity and co-morbid ailments makes you disabled, therefore it's the responsibility of the rest of society to spend thousands of dollars to buy you an electric scooter so you can get around.\n\nIt shouldn't be covered by insurance, but the reality is that the problem it's solving isn't the obesity itself, but rather what resulted from the obesity.

Here are some reasons why mobility scooters may be prescribed or provided for these individuals:\n1. Mobility difficulties: Morbid obesity can lead to joint problems, muscle weakness, and decreased flexibility, making it difficult for individuals to walk or stand for long periods of time. A mobility scooter can provide a means of transportation that is easier on the body and allows for greater mobility.\n2. Fatigue: Carrying excess weight can lead to fatigue, which can make it difficult to perform daily activities such as grocery shopping or running errands. A mobility scooter can help individuals conserve energy and reduce fatigue by providing a means of transportation that is less physically demanding.\n3. Safety concerns: Individuals who are morbidly obese may be at higher risk for falls or injuries due to their weight. A mobility scooter can provide additional support and stability, reducing the risk of falls and injuries.\n4. Social isolation: Morbid obesity can lead to social isolation due to feelings of embarrassment or shame. Using a mobility scooter can help individuals maintain their independence and social interactions, reducing feelings of isolation.\n5. Accessibility: Mobility scooters can provide access to areas that may be difficult or impossible to reach on foot, such as public transportation or shopping centers.\nIt is important to note that mobility scooters are not a permanent solution and should be used in conjunction with other forms of exercise and physical therapy to promote weight loss and improve overall health. Additionally, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using a mobility scooter, as they can provide guidance on proper use and maintenance.\nIn summary, mobility scooters can be a helpful tool for individuals who are morbidly obese to improve their mobility and independence, but it is important to use them responsibly and in conjunction with other forms of exercise and therapy to promote overall health and well-being.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.27309236947791166, "rouge2": 0.03225806451612904, "rougeL": 0.14457831325301207, "rougeLsum": 0.2369477911646586}, "known": true}

For example, during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten (1353-1336 BCE), the priesthood and other powerful groups resisted his attempts to introduce monotheistic worship and challenge the traditional pantheon of gods.\n2. Ancient Greece (circa 5th century BCE): In ancient Greece, the concept of civil disobedience was explored in the works of philosophers such as Socrates, who believed that disobedience could be justified in cases where the laws of the state conflicted with moral principles. For example, Socrates was put on trial and executed for \"corrupting the youth\" and impiety, acts of civil disobedience against the Athenian state.\n3. Ancient Rome (circa 1st century CE): During the Roman Republic, civil disobedience was used as a means of political protest and resistance. For example, the Roman philosopher and statesman Cicero famously advocated for civil disobedience in his defense of Catiline, a politician who was accused of plotting to overthrow the government.\n4. Early Christianity (circa 1st-5th centuries CE): Early Christians often engaged in acts of civil disobedience, such as refusing to pay taxes to the Roman Empire or participating in illegal gatherings, in order to express their religious beliefs and challenge the authority of the state.\n5. Indian subcontinent (circa 6th century BCE-5th century CE): In ancient India, civil disobedience was used as a means of political protest and resistance, particularly in the context of the caste system and social inequality. For example, the Buddhist monk Gautama Buddha is said to have challenged the caste system and the authority of the Brahmin priests, leading to the development of Buddhism as a major religious and political force", "ppl": 3.8507957458496094, "known": true}

Here are some of the main ways in which languages have developed:\n1. Gradual Evolution: Languages have evolved gradually over time through a process of incremental changes, known as linguistic drift. This can occur through a variety of mechanisms, such as language contact, borrowing, and diffusion.\n2. Language Contact: When speakers of different languages interact with one another, they may exchange words, phrases, and grammatical structures, leading to the development of new languages or dialects.\n3. Borrowing: One language may borrow words or structures from another language, either through direct contact or through a mediating language.\n4. Diffusion: As a language spreads geographically or through cultural exchange, it may undergo changes in response to the new context in which it is being used.\n5. Language Isolation: A language may become isolated from other languages through geographical or cultural barriers, leading to the development of distinct linguistic features.\n6. Genetic Inheritance: Languages may be related through genetic ties, such as descent from a common ancestral language.\n7. Neolinguistics: The study of language change and development, including the structure and evolution of languages, as well as the social and cultural factors that influence language use.\n8. Sociolinguistics: The study of the relationship between language and society, including how language use reflects and shapes social identity, power dynamics, and cultural norms.\n9. Psycholinguistics: The study of how language is processed in the mind, including how speakers acquire, store, and produce language.\n10. Computational Linguistics: The study of how language is processed and analyzed using computational models and algorithms, including natural language processing, machine learning, and text analysis.\n111. Historical Linguistics: The study of the history of languages, including their origins, evolution, and relationships.\n12. Comparative Linguistics: The study of the similarities and differences between languages, including their grammar, vocabulary, and syntax.\n13. Etymology: The study of the origins and histories of words and their meanings.\n14.

United States case was a landmark Supreme Court decision in 1971 that involved a challenge to the government's subpoena of the Pentagon Papers, a secret history of the Vietnam War. The case was brought by the New York Times and other news organizations against the Nixon administration, which had sought to stop the publication of the Papers on the grounds that they were classified and could harm national security.\nThe Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of the New York Times and other news organizations, holding that the government had failed to demonstrate that the release of the Papers would cause significant harm to national security. The Court found that the First Amendment protected the right of the press to publish information of public concern, even if it was classified or sensitive, and that the government had not met its burden of showing that the Papers should be kept secret.\nIn a 6-3 decision, the Court held that the government's subpoena of the Papers was unconstitutional and that the New York Times and other news organizations were entitled to immunity from prosecution under the Espionage Act for publishing the Papers. The decision was a major victory for the press and a significant expansion of the First Amendment's protection of freedom of the press.\nJustice Hugo Black, writing for the majority, stated that \"the First Amendment does not allow a government to restrict the flow of information to the public through the medium of the press.\" He also noted that \"the government's power to censor the press is not unlimited, and that the First Amendment 'protects the public's right to know.'\"\nIn summary, the New York Times won the case, as the Supreme Court ruled in their favor and held that the government had failed to demonstrate that the release of the Pentagon Papers would cause significant harm to national security, and that the First Amendment protected the right of the press to publish information of public concern.", "known": true}

The executive branch acted in the name of the King (\"His Majesty's Government\"), as did the judiciary.

One minister, the Lord Chancellor, was at the same time the sole judge in the Court of Chancery and the presiding officer in the House of Lords.

These chemicals are produced within the plant and play a crucial role in controlling cell division, cell expansion, cell differentiation, and other physiological processes that are essential for plant growth and development.\nThere are several types of plant growth regulators, including:\n1. Auxins: Auxins are involved in cell elongation and cell division, and play a key role in stem elongation, root growth, and vascular differentiation. Examples of auxins include indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), and naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA).\n2. Cytokinins: Cytokinins promote cell division and differentiation, and are involved in the formation of meristems and the development of roots, stems, and leaves. Examples of cytokinins include kinetin and zeatin.\n3. Ethylene: Ethylene is involved in fruit ripening, senescence (aging), and abscission (fruit drop). It is also involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation.\n4. Gibberellins: Gibberellins are involved in stem elongation, seed germination, and flower formation. Examples of gibberellins include gibberellic acid (GA3) and paclobutrazol (PBZ).\n5. Abscisic acid (ABA): ABA is involved in stress responses, such as drought tolerance, and is also involved in seed dormancy and abscission.\n6. Salicylic acid (SA): SA is involved in defense responses to pathogens and pests, and is also involved in cell death and differentiation.\n7. Brassinosteroids: Brassinosteroids are involved in cell growth and differentiation, and are important for plant defense responses. Examples of brassinosteroids include brassinolide and 24-epibrassinolide.\n8.

Both the current generation i5 and i7 processors have 6 chefs.  The chef receives a set of ingredients and a recipe, and lays it all out on the table.  This table is like a processor's cache - it's the memory that the processor has to work with.\n\nThe chef then prepares the meals, and puts them back on the table.  Now, the chef has to wait for the waiters to clean up the table and bring new ingredients.  The chef busts out his phone and takes a break while this happens.\n\nHyperthreading is like giving the chef 2 tables.  Now, while the chef is cooking one set of meals from table A, the staff can clear table B and bring new ingredients.  Once table A is complete, table B is ready for cooking.  The chef can now switch back and forth between the two tables and have almost no down time.\n\nOne of the other big differences is the size of the table - that is, the size of the cache.  i7's generally have larger cache sizes than i5's do, which can help them do more work in the same amount of time.\n\nEdit: Just realized that I didn't really help you make a decision.  :)\n\nHaving more cores is only useful in certain situations.  When the work can be 'parallelized,' - that is, divided up such that the result from one chunk of work doesn't depend on the result of the previous chunk of work - then being able to handle more concurrent threads is a very good thing.  \n\nFor example, if you're building a house, you need to pour the foundation before you can set up framing, and you need to set up framing before you can run electrical and plumbing lines, and you need to set up electrical and plumbing before you can put up drywall, etc.  It's not possible to split a task like that up into several chunks and do them all simultaneously.\n\nIf you're building 20 houses, you can pour all 20 foundations at once, set up all 20 frames at once, etc.  The result of building part of one house doesn't depend on the construction of other houses.\n\nTo a CPU, gaming is often like building a house.  The calculations for one moment in the game will influence subsequent moments in the game, so it's not possible to divide the work up among several processor cores.\n\nVideo editing, on the other hand is highly parallelizable.  Rendering frame #25 doesn't usually depend on the results of rendering frame #20, so software can divide that work up and distribute it across the processing cores.\n\nTL:DR; Gaming doesn't usually benefit as much from multiple processing cores.

Clock Speed:\n\t* Intel Core i5: 3.5 GHz - 3.7 GHz (base clock speed)\n\t* Intel Core i7: 3.7 GHz - 4.5 GHz (base clock speed)\nThe higher clock speed of i7 processors means they can handle more demanding tasks and perform better under heavy loads.\n3. Turbo Boost:\n\t* Intel Core i5: Up to 3.9 GHz (turbo boost)\n\t* Intel Core i7: Up to 4.5 GHz (turbo boost)\nTurbo Boost is a technology that allows the processor to increase its clock speed when needed, which can result in better performance during demanding tasks. i7 processors have a higher turbo boost frequency than i5 processors, which means they can handle more demanding tasks.\n4. Hyper-Threading:\n\t* Intel Core i5: Supports hyper-threading\n\t* Intel Core i7: Supports hyper-threading\nHyper-threading is a technology that allows each core to handle two threads simultaneously, which can improve performance in tasks that can take advantage of this technology.

At the time, there was no clear definition of what constituted a \"woman,\" and some intersex athletes were competing in women's events without undergoing any gender-affirming treatment.\n2. 1968: The IOC established a Medical Commission, which was tasked with developing guidelines for gender testing. The guidelines included a requirement that athletes provide medical documentation of their gender status, and that they undergo a physical examination by a designated medical officer.\n3. 1975: The IOC introduced the first formal gender testing regulations, which required athletes to provide documentation of their gender status and undergo a physical examination before competing in the Olympics. The regulations also established a \"gender typicality\" standard, which defined a woman as someone who had undergone hormone therapy and surgery to align their body with their gender identity.\n4. 1988: The IOC introduced a new gender testing policy that required athletes to provide documentation of their gender status and undergo a physical examination every four years. The policy also established a \"biological sex\" standard, which defined a woman as someone who was assigned female at birth based on their anatomy.\n5. 1990s: Advocacy groups began to challenge the IOC's gender testing policies, arguing that they were discriminatory and violated the human rights of intersex athletes. In 1992, the IOC established a working group to review its gender testing policies, but the group failed to reach a consensus on how to address the issue.\n6. 2003: The IOC introduced a new gender testing policy that eliminated the \"gender typicality\" and \"biological sex\" standards and replaced them with a more nuanced approach that took into account the individual circumstances of each athlete.

The size, shape, and tension of the vocal cords can affect the pitch, tone, and quality of a person's voice.\n2. Resonance Chambers: The resonance chambers, including the mouth, nasal cavities, and sinuses, affect the way sound waves are modified and amplified. The size and shape of these chambers, as well as the amount of air and mucus inside them, can alter the timbre and tone of a person's voice.\n3. Breathing: The way a person breathes can also impact the way their voice sounds. The amount of air in the lungs, the rate of breathing, and the way the diaphragm moves can all affect the volume, pitch, and tone of the voice.\n4. Neck and Throat Muscles: The muscles in the neck and throat can also influence the way a person's voice sounds. The tension and position of these muscles can affect the pitch, tone, and quality of the voice.\n5. Age: As people age, their voices can change in terms of pitch, tone, and quality. For example, older people may experience a loss of vocal range, a deeper voice, or a more gravelly tone.\n6. Gender: A person's gender can also affect the way their voice sounds. Men generally have lower voices than women, and women may have a higher pitched voice.\n7. Emotions: A person's emotional state can also impact the way their voice sounds. For example, when a person is angry or excited, their voice may be louder or more strained than usual.\n8. Medical Conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as vocal cord injuries, nodules, or polyps, can affect the way a person's voice sounds.

In a graph, each edge connects exactly two vertices, while in a hypergraph, each edge can connect any number of vertices.\nFormally, a hypergraph is defined as a pair $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a set of edges, such that:\n1. For each edge $e \\in E$, there are at least two vertices in $V$ that are connected by $e$.\n2. For each vertex $v \\in V$, there are at most one or no edges incident to $v$.\nIn other words, a hypergraph is a collection of vertices and edges, where each edge can connect any number of vertices, but each vertex can only be part of at most one edge.\nHere are some key differences between graphs and hypergraphs:\n1. Number of edges: In a graph, each edge connects exactly two vertices, while in a hypergraph, each edge can connect any number of vertices.\n2. Vertices: In a graph, each vertex can only be part of one edge, while in a hypergraph, each vertex can be part of multiple edges.\n3. Degree: In a graph, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, while in a hypergraph, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, including the edges that connect it to itself.\n4. Connectivity: In a graph, two vertices are connected if they are adjacent, while in a hypergraph, two vertices are connected if they are part of the same edge.\n5. Subgraphs: In a graph, a subgraph is a graph that is induced by a subset of the vertices, while in a hypergraph, a subgraph is a hypergraph that is induced by a subset of the vertices and edges.\n6. Matchings: In a graph, a matching is a set of edges that cover all the vertices, while in a hypergraph, a matching is a set of edges that cover all the vertices and do not contain any edge that connects two vertices more than once.\n7. Coloring: In a graph, a coloring is a function that assigns a color to each edge, while in a hypergraph, a coloring is a function that assigns a color", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.21487603305785125, "rouge2": 0.07053941908713691, "rougeL": 0.1487603305785124, "rougeLsum": 0.18181818181818182}, "known": true}

Here are some reasons why:\n1. Focus on storytelling and artistic merit: The Oscars are primarily concerned with recognizing and rewarding films that demonstrate exceptional storytelling, direction, acting, cinematography, and other artistic elements. Genre is just one aspect of a film, and the Academy wants to avoid limiting its focus to a particular type of movie.\n2. Wide range of genres: The Academy recognizes a wide range of genres, including drama, documentary, animated, and foreign-language films. By not having a separate category for comedy, the Academy can recognize and honor films from all genres without favoring one over another.\n3. Subjectivity of comedy: Comedy is a highly subjective genre, and what one person finds funny, another might not. The Academy wants to avoid creating a category that could be perceived as biased or limited in its scope.\n4. Inclusion of comedy elements in other categories: Many films that are nominated for Oscars include elements of comedy, such as witty dialogue, comedic performances, or lighthearted themes. These elements are already recognized and honored in other categories, such as Best Screenplay, Best Actor/Actress in a Leading Role, and Best Picture.\n5. Historical evolution: The Oscars have evolved over time, and the categories have changed to reflect the changing landscape of the film industry. While comedy was once a distinct genre, it has become increasingly difficult to define and distinguish from other genres. As a result, the Academy has chosen not to create a separate category for comedy.\n6. Focus on artistic merit: The Academy's ultimate goal is to recognize and reward films that demonstrate exceptional artistic merit, regardless of genre. By not having a separate category for comedy, the Academy can focus on recognizing films that excel in other areas, such as direction, acting, or cinematography.\n7. Global appeal: The Oscars are an international awards ceremony, and the Academy wants to recognize films that appeal to a global audience.

Intersex is when you're kinda neither"], "llama7b_without_search_answer": " Cisgender, transgender, and intersex are terms that refer to different aspects of a person's gender identity and biology.\nCisgender (CIS):\n* Cisgender is a term used to describe people whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth. In other words, a person who identifies as male or female based on their physical characteristics, such as genitalia, chromosomes, and hormone levels.\n* Cisgender people do not experience any discomfort or dissonance between their gender identity and their biological sex.\nTransgender:\n* Transgender is a term used to describe people whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. In other words, a person who identifies as male, female, or non-binary (a third gender) despite being born with physical characteristics that do not fit typical binary gender categories.\n* Transgender people may experience gender dysphoria, which is a feeling of distress or discomfort due to the mismatch between their gender identity and their biological sex.\nIntersex:\n* Intersex is a term used to describe people who are born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn't fit typical male or female classifications. This can include a variety of characteristics, such as chromosomes, gonads, or genitals that are not typical for either males or females.\n* Intersex people may or may not identify as male, female, or non-binary, and they may or may not experience gender dysphoria.\nIt's important to note that these terms are not mutually exclusive, and some people may identify as multiple genders or have a fluid gender identity. It's also important to recognize that gender identity and biology are separate and distinct, and that a person's gender identity is their own to claim and express.\nIt's also worth noting that the term \"transgender\" is often used as an umbrella term to include all people whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth, including but not limited to:\n* Trans men: people who were assigned female at birth but identify as male.\n* Trans women: people who were assigned male at birth but identify as female.\n* Non-binary: people who do not identify as exclusively male or female, but rather as something in between, outside", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.3875205254515599, "rouge2": 0.07248764415156508, "rougeL": 0.15435139573070608, "rougeLsum": 0.3185550082101806}, "known": true}

Technical limitations: Rain can be difficult to capture on camera, especially if it is light or intermittent. TV broadcasters may not have the necessary equipment or technology to effectively capture and transmit rain footage.\n2. Weather conditions: The weather conditions during a sporting event can play a significant role in determining whether or not rain is shown on TV. If the rain is heavy or persistent, it may be difficult or impossible to broadcast the event live. In some cases, the broadcaster may choose to delay or cancel the broadcast altogether.\n3. Game delay: If the rain is light or intermittent, the broadcaster may choose to delay the broadcast of the game until the rain subsides. This allows them to capture better quality footage and provide a more enjoyable viewing experience for the audience.\n4. Game cancellation: If the rain is too heavy or persistent, the broadcaster may choose to cancel the game altogether. This is especially common in outdoor sports like baseball or soccer, where the rain can make the field unplayable.\n5. Game rescheduling: If the rain causes a delay or cancellation of the game, the broadcaster may choose to reschedule the game for a later date. This allows them to capture better quality footage and provide a more enjoyable viewing experience for the audience.\n6. Focus on other aspects of the game: While rain can be an important aspect of a sporting event, TV broadcasters may choose to focus on other aspects of the game that are more relevant or exciting to the audience. For example, they may focus on the action on the field, the strategies of the teams, or the performances of individual players.\n7. Legal and ethical considerations: TV broadcasters may also be limited by legal and ethical considerations when it comes to showing rain in sports TV broadcasts. For example, they may be required to obtain permission from the teams or players before showing certain footage, or they may be limited in their ability to show footage that could be considered offensive or inappropriate.\n8. Cost considerations: Finally, TV broadcasters may also be limited by cost considerations when it comes to showing rain in sports TV broadcasts.

Here are some reasons why:\n1. Overuse and misuse of sterilization methods: The overuse or misuse of sterilization methods can lead to the selection of resistant microorganisms. For example, if alcohol-based hand sanitizers are used too frequently or inappropriately, bacteria may develop resistance to their effects.\n2. Lack of proper sterilization techniques: Improper sterilization techniques can also contribute to the development of resistant microorganisms. For instance, if medical equipment is not properly cleaned and disinfected before sterilization, some microorganisms may survive the process and develop resistance.\n3. Cross-resistance: Bacteria and viruses can develop cross-resistance to different types of sterilization methods, making them more difficult to kill. For example, a bacterium that has developed resistance to alcohol may also be resistant to other disinfectants like quaternary ammonium compounds.\n4. Horizontal gene transfer: Microorganisms can share genes that confer resistance to antimicrobial agents, allowing them to adapt to new environments and develop resistance more quickly. This can make it challenging to control the spread of resistant microorganisms.\n5. Emergence of new resistant strains: New strains of bacteria and viruses are constantly emerging, and some of these may be resistant to existing sterilization methods. For example, the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has made it more challenging to treat bacterial infections.\n6. Limited effectiveness of sterilization methods: Sterilization methods may not always be effective against all microorganisms, especially those that are highly resistant or have a low infectious dose. For example, steam sterilization may not be effective against some bacterial spores, and some viruses may survive the sterilization process.\n7. Cost and time constraints: The use of some sterilization methods, such as autoclaving, can be expensive and time-consuming, which may limit their use in some settings.

They are commonly used in a wide range of applications, including robotics, automotive, and industrial machinery. Here's how they work:\n1. Basic Components:\nA planetary gearset consists of three basic components:\n* Sun gear: This is the central gear that rotates around its axis and provides the input motion.\n* Planet gears: These are the gears that rotate around the sun gear and are connected to the output shaft.\n* Ring gear: This is the outermost gear that rotates around the planet gears and provides the output motion.\n2. Operation:\nThe operation of a planetary gearset can be understood by considering the following steps:\n* The sun gear rotates around its axis, causing the planet gears to rotate.\n* The planet gears rotate around the sun gear, transferring the motion to the ring gear.\n* The ring gear rotates around the planet gears, providing the output motion.\n3. Ratio of Speed and Torque:\nThe ratio of speed and torque between the input and output shafts of a planetary gearset can be calculated using the following formulae:\n* Ratio of speed: The ratio of the speed of the output shaft to the speed of the input shaft is given by the number of teeth on the ring gear divided by the number of teeth on the sun gear.\n* Ratio of torque: The ratio of the torque at the output shaft to the torque at the input shaft is given by the number of teeth on the ring gear divided by the number of teeth on the sun gear squared.\n4. Advantages:\nPlanetary gearsets have several advantages, including:\n* High reduction ratio: Planetary gearsets can provide a high reduction ratio, making them suitable for applications where a small input shaft rotation needs to drive a larger output shaft rotation.\n* High efficiency: Planetary gearsets are highly efficient, with efficiency levels of up to 90%.\n* Compact design: Planetary gearsets are compact and lightweight, making them ideal for applications where space is limited.\n5.

It states that if a function is continuous on a closed interval and has a derivative at each point in the interval, then there exists a polynomial that passes through all the points of the function and its derivatives.\nMore formally, let $f$ be a function that is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and let $f'(x)$ be the derivative of $f$. Then, according to Lagrange's Theorem, there exists a polynomial $P(x)$ such that:\n$$f(x) = P(x) + R(x)$$\nwhere $R(x)$ is a remainder term that satisfies the following conditions:\n$$\\left|R(x)\\right| < \\frac{1}{b-a}\\left|f'(x)\\right|$$\nfor all $x \\in [a, b]$.\nIn other words, Lagrange's Theorem states that any continuous function on a closed interval can be approximated by a polynomial that passes through all the points of the function and its derivatives.\nThe proof of Lagrange's Theorem involves using the definition of a derivative to find a polynomial that passes through the points of the function and its derivatives.

Here are some reasons why data loss can occur in Wi-Fi networks:\n1. Interference: Wi-Fi signals can be disrupted by other devices operating on the same frequency, causing data packets to be lost or corrupted.\n2. Distance: As the distance between the device and the Wi-Fi access point increases, the signal strength decreases, leading to a higher likelihood of data loss.\n3. Multipath interference: Signals can bounce off walls, floors, and other objects, causing multiple versions of the signal to arrive at the receiver at slightly different times, which can cause data loss.\n4. Packet errors: Data packets can be lost or corrupted during transmission due to errors in the Wi-Fi protocol or other factors.\n5. Network congestion: When many devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network, it can lead to network congestion, which can cause data loss or slow down the network.\n6. Malicious attacks: Hackers can intentionally disrupt Wi-Fi signals or steal data packets, leading to data loss.\n7. Fading: Wi-Fi signals can fade over time due to changes in the environment, leading to data loss.\nTo mitigate data loss in Wi-Fi networks, several techniques can be used, including:\n1. Error correction: Using error correction techniques such as Forward Error Correction (FEC) or Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) to detect and correct errors in data packets.\n2. Data compression: Compressing data before transmitting it over Wi-Fi to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, which can help reduce the likelihood of data loss.\n3. Quality of Service (QoS): Implementing QoS policies to prioritize traffic and ensure that critical applications receive sufficient bandwidth and low latency, reducing the likelihood of data loss.\n4. Network segmentation: Segmenting the Wi-Fi network into smaller sub-networks to reduce the impact of data loss in one area of the network on the entire network.\n5.

From the time of the spring equinox until the fall equinox, the further north you go (in the northern hemisphere), the longer the day is.  And then with time zones, an entire section of earth is kept on the same clock time, but the sun passes over it in a progressive way. So ideally, when it's 12 noon, the sun should be directly overhead. In practical terms, that's not possible because the time zone is too wide for that. The sun may be directly overhead at noon in the middle of the time zone, but not in either extreme edge of the time zone. So with the sun setting in the west, that means that the sun sets earliest in the eastern part of a time zone and it sets latest in the western part of a time zone. That's going to be true no matter what time of year it is. So for example, check out the eastern standard time zone. That's a very wide time zone. Furthest east is eastern Maine and furthest west is western Indiana. It might be pitch dark in western Indiana while the sun is rising in eastern Maine, because even though the two areas are on the same clock time, they're really far apart east to west and it takes time for the sun to reach the westernmost part of the time zone. By the time the sun in setting in Indiana, it may already have been night for almost an hour in Maine. \n\nMeanwhile, that same time zone has (in the USA) northern Maine as its northernmost point, and the Florida Keys as the southernmost point. The closer you get to the equator, the less the length of a day changes due to seasons. At the equator, a day is close to 12 hours long all year round. In Florida, which is not at the equator but it's a lot closer to the equator than the northern US is, there's some variation of day length so that days are longer in summer, but it's not a huge variation. In contrast, if you are at the arctic circle in the middle of the summer, the days are so long that the sun doesn't set at all and it's daylight 24/7 for weeks. In Maine, which is a good distance south of the arctic circle, but a lot closer to it than Florida is, days are very long in summer and very short in winter.\n\nSo you have to take into account these factors when determining time of sunrise and sunset on any given day in any given area. The sun will set much earlier in Maine than in Florida during the winter, because Maine has very short days in winter.

That's going to be true no matter what time of year it is. So for example, check out the eastern standard time zone. That's a very wide time zone. Furthest east is eastern Maine and furthest west is western Indiana. It might be pitch dark in western Indiana while the sun is rising in eastern Maine, because even though the two areas are on the same clock time, they're really far apart east to west and it takes time for the sun to reach the westernmost part of the time zone. By the time the sun in setting in Indiana, it may already have been night for almost an hour in Maine. \n\nMeanwhile, that same time zone has (in the USA) northern Maine as its northernmost point, and the Florida Keys as the southernmost point. The closer you get to the equator, the less the length of a day changes due to seasons. At the equator, a day is close to 12 hours long all year round. In Florida, which is not at the equator but it's a lot closer to the equator than the northern US is, there's some variation of day length so that days are longer in summer, but it's not a huge variation. In contrast, if you are at the arctic circle in the middle of the summer, the days are so long that the sun doesn't set at all and it's daylight 24/7 for weeks. In Maine, which is a good distance south of the arctic circle, but a lot closer to it than Florida is, days are very long in summer and very short in winter.\n\nSo you have to take into account these factors when determining time of sunrise and sunset on any given day in any given area. The sun will set much earlier in Maine than in Florida during the winter, because Maine has very short days in winter. But the sun will set much *later* in Maine than in Florida during the summer, because Maine has very long days in summer.  But eastern Maine is further east than Florida, meaning that the sun may rise earlier in Maine than in Florida", "The easiest way to understand is to click here to see how the terminator mapped onto the earth's surface for last night's sunset on the US west coast:\n\n_URL_0_"], "llama7b_without_search_answer": " The reason for the difference in sunset times along the west coast of the United States is due to the curvature of the Earth and the rotation of the planet on its axis. Here are some factors that contribute to the variation in sunset times:\n1. Latitude: The latitude of a location plays a significant role in determining the time of sunset. As you move northward along the west coast, the latitude increases, which means the sun's rays have to travel a longer distance through the atmosphere to reach the horizon. This results in a later sunset time.\n2. Longitude: The longitude of a location also affects the time of sunset. The west coast of the United States stretches from approximately 122°W to 145°W, which means that locations closer to the Pacific Ocean (to the west) will have a later sunset than those closer to the Rocky Mountains (to the east).\n3. Time zone: The west coast of the United States is located in the Pacific Time Zone (UTC-8), which is one hour behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This means that the sunset time will be later in the Pacific Time Zone than in other time zones.\n4. Atmospheric conditions: The atmosphere can also affect the time of sunset. For example, if there are high-pressure systems or clear skies, the sun will appear higher in the sky and will set later. On the other hand, if there are low-pressure systems or clouds, the sun will appear lower in the sky and will set earlier.\n5. Distance from the coast: The distance from the coastline can also influence the time of sunset. Locations farther inland will experience a later sunset than those closer to the coast, as they are further away from the moderating influence of the ocean.\nIn summary, the combination of these factors explains why sunset times vary along the west coast of the United States. San Francisco is located at a slightly higher latitude than San Diego and Seattle, which means it experiences a later sunset. Additionally, San Francisco is located in a time zone that is one hour behind UTC, which further contributes to the difference in sunset times.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.41098901098901097, "rouge2": 0.1299559471365639, "rougeL": 0.19780219780219782, "rougeLsum": 0.3142857142857143}, "known": true}

Fractures can be caused by a variety of factors, including tectonic forces, weathering, and erosion.\n3. Joints: These are fractures that occur when rocks break along a planar surface, often as a result of tectonic forces or weathering. Joints can be either open (where the rock on one side of the joint is exposed) or closed (where the rock on both sides of the joint is still intact).\n4. Shear zones: These are areas where rocks have been deformed by tectonic forces, resulting in a series of fractures and folds in the rock layers. Shear zones can be either linear or curvilinear in shape, and can be tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers long.\n5. Lineations: These are fractures that occur when rocks are broken along a linear plane, often as a result of tectonic forces or weathering. Lineations can be either open or closed, and can be oriented in different directions depending on the geological processes that formed them.\n6. Dikes: These are fractures that occur when magma or other fluids flow through the Earth's crust, creating a new layer of rock.

Here are some reasons why teachers may choose to continue spending their own money despite the financial burden:\n1. Personal investment: Teachers are passionate about their work and want to provide the best possible learning environment for their students. They may feel that investing their own money in classroom supplies is a way to show their commitment to their students and the education system.\n2. Limited school budgets: Many schools have limited budgets for classroom supplies, and teachers may not receive adequate support or reimbursement for their expenses. By spending their own money, teachers can help supplement the resources available to their students.\n3. Differentiation: Teachers may use their own money to purchase materials that cater to the individual needs of their students, such as specialized learning aids or accommodations for students with disabilities.\n4. Building relationships: Teachers may use their own money to buy small gifts or treats for their students, such as pencils, stickers, or other incentives, to help build positive relationships and create a more welcoming classroom environment.\n5. Professional development: Teachers may use their own money to attend professional development workshops or conferences, which can help them stay up-to-date on the latest teaching methods and best practices.\n6. Personal sacrifice: For some teachers, spending their own money on classroom supplies is a personal sacrifice that they feel is necessary to provide the best possible education for their students.\nIt's important to note that the financial burden of purchasing classroom supplies can be significant, and it's not something that teachers should have to bear alone. Schools and districts should provide adequate support and resources to help teachers cover these costs, including budgeting for classroom supplies and providing reimbursement for expenses incurred by teachers.\nIn summary, while it may seem counterintuitive that teachers would choose to spend their own money on classroom supplies, it's often a necessary measure to ensure that students have the resources they need to succeed.

Here are some possible reasons:\n1. Reduced motor speed: As the battery voltage drops, the motor speed also decreases. This is because the motor is designed to operate at a specific voltage range, and when the voltage drops below that range, the motor cannot spin as fast. To compensate for the reduced voltage, the toy's circuitry may reduce the motor speed to prolong the battery life.\n2. Voltage regulation: Many toys have a voltage regulator circuit that helps maintain a stable voltage level for the motor and other electronic components. When the battery voltage drops, the voltage regulator reduces the voltage supplied to the motor to prevent damage to the motor or other components. This reduction in voltage can result in a slower motor speed.\n3. Power conservation: Toy manufacturers often design their products to conserve power when the battery voltage drops. By reducing the motor speed, they can extend the battery life and ensure that the toy continues to function for a longer period. This is especially important for toys that are designed to provide continuous sound effects, such as music boxes or talking toys.\n4. Safety considerations: Some toys may have safety features that slow down the motor when the battery voltage drops to prevent overheating or other damage. For example, some toys may have thermal cutoffs that turn off the motor when the battery voltage drops below a certain level to prevent overheating.\nIn summary, the slowing down of sounds made by kids' toys when the batteries start getting low is a deliberate design feature that helps to conserve power, prolong battery life, and ensure the safe operation of the toy.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.3188976377952756, "rouge2": 0.05138339920948616, "rougeL": 0.17322834645669288, "rougeLsum": 0.2795275590551181}, "known": true}

Here are some of the ways that early calendars kept track of time efficiently:\n1. Observation of celestial bodies: Many early calendars were based on the observation of celestial bodies such as the sun, moon, and stars. For example, the ancient Egyptians used the position of the Nile River to determine the start of their calendar year, while the Mayans in Mesoamerica used the position of the sun and moon to create their calendar.\n2. Cyclical patterns: Early calendars often used cyclical patterns to divide the year into smaller units of time. For example, the ancient Babylonians used a cycle of 19 years to divide their calendar into intercalary months.\n3. Lunar cycles: Many early calendars were based on the cycles of the moon, with each month beginning on the new moon. This allowed for a relatively accurate way of tracking time, as the lunar cycle is approximately 29.5 days long.\n4. Solar cycles: Some early calendars were based on the cycles of the sun, with each year beginning on the winter solstice or the summer solstice. This allowed for a relatively accurate way of tracking time, as the solar year is approximately 365.24 days long.\n5. Intercalary days: Many early calendars included intercalary days, which were days added to the calendar to keep it in sync with the solar year. For example, the ancient Egyptians added five days to their calendar every four years to account for the extra time in the solar year.\n6. Astronomical observations: Many early calendars were based on astronomical observations, such as the position of the stars and planets. For example, the ancient Mayans used the position of the planet Venus to determine the start of their calendar year.\n7. Mathematical calculations: Some early calendars were based on mathematical calculations, such as the number of days in a year or the position of the moon. For example, the ancient Babylonians used mathematical calculations to determine the start of their new year.\n8.

Here are some of the main factors:\n1. Oversupply: The global oil market has been experiencing an oversupply of crude oil, which has put downward pressure on prices. This is due to a combination of factors, including increased production in countries such as the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, as well as lower demand from China and other emerging markets.\n2. Decline in global demand: As the global economy has slowed down, demand for oil has also decreased, further contributing to the oversupply situation. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global oil demand grew at its slowest pace in five years in 2019.\n3. Shift to renewable energy: There is a growing trend towards renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, which are becoming more cost-competitive with fossil fuels. This shift is leading to a decrease in demand for oil, particularly in the power generation sector.\n4. Technological advancements: Advances in technology have made it possible to extract oil from unconventional sources, such as shale and tight oil formations, which were previously considered uneconomical to produce. This has led to a surge in production from these sources, contributing to the oversupply situation.\n5. Geopolitical tensions: Political instability and conflicts in oil-producing countries, such as Libya and Venezuela, have disrupted oil supply lines and contributed to the oversupply situation.\n6. Strengthening of the US dollar: The strengthening of the US dollar has made oil more expensive for countries using other currencies, which can lead to lower demand and prices.\n7. Increased competition from electric vehicles: As electric vehicles (EVs) become more popular, they are starting to compete with oil-powered vehicles, which can lead to a decrease in demand for oil.\n8. Improved energy efficiency: Improved energy efficiency in various industries, such as transportation and manufacturing, has led to a decrease in demand for oil.\n9.

Scott's work influenced the late 19th-century children's writer Howard Pyle's book The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, which in turn established John as the principal villain within the traditional Robin Hood narrative. During the 20th century, John was normally depicted in fictional books and films alongside Robin Hood. Sam De Grasse's role as John in the black-and-white 1922 film version shows John committing numerous atrocities and acts of torture. Claude Rains played John in the 1938 colour version alongside Errol Flynn, starting a trend for films to depict John as an \"effeminate ... arrogant and cowardly stay-at-home\". The character of John acts either to highlight the virtues of King Richard, or contrasts with the Sheriff of Nottingham, who is usually the \"swashbuckling villain\" opposing Robin. An extreme version of this trend can be seen in the Disney cartoon version, for example, which depicts John, voiced by Peter Ustinov, as a \"cowardly, thumbsucking lion\". Popular works that depict John beyond the Robin Hood legends, such as James Goldman's play and later film, The Lion in Winter, set in 1183, commonly present him as an \"effete weakling\", in this instance contrasted with the more masculine Henry II, or as a tyrant, as in A.

Here are some of the factors that may influence the prosecutor's decision to offer a plea bargain:\n\n1. Evidence strength: The prosecutor will consider the strength of the evidence against the defendant and the likelihood of securing a conviction if the case goes to trial. If the evidence is weak or there are inconsistencies in the witness statements, the prosecutor may be more willing to offer a plea bargain.\n2. Defendant's criminal history: The prosecutor will consider the defendant's prior criminal record, if any, and the severity of the current offense. If the defendant has a clean record or the current offense is relatively minor, the prosecutor may be more willing to offer a plea bargain.\n3. Defendant's cooperation: If the defendant is willing to cooperate with the investigation or provide information that could help the prosecutor build a stronger case, the prosecutor may be more willing to offer a plea bargain.\n4. Sentencing guidelines: The prosecutor will consider the sentencing guidelines for the crime and the defendant's criminal history. If the guidelines call for a longer sentence than the prosecutor is willing to seek, they may offer a plea bargain to avoid a longer sentence.\n5. Caseload: The prosecutor will consider their caseload and the resources available to them. If they have a heavy caseload, they may be more willing to offer plea bargains to reduce their workload.\n6. Political considerations: The prosecutor may be influenced by political considerations, such as the desire to maintain good relations with law enforcement agencies or the community.\n7. Defense requests: The prosecutor may consider the defense's requests, such as a request for a specific sentence or a request to dismiss certain charges.\n8. Legal constraints: The prosecutor must consider any legal constraints that may limit their ability to offer a plea bargain, such as the statute of limitations or the defendant's right to a speedy trial.\n\nIt's worth noting that the defendant", "known": true}

According to Pausanias, the first Olympic Games were held in 776 BC to honor Zeus, the king of the gods, and were organized by the Greek chieftains of the region.

Here is a brief overview of some of the major pre-Columbian civilizations in Mexico:\n\n1. Olmecs: The Olmecs were one of the earliest known civilizations in Mesoamerica, dating back to around 1500 BCE. They established complex societies in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, including the states of Veracruz and Tabasco.\n2. Maya: The Maya civilization flourished in the southeastern part of Mexico, as well as in Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras, from around 2000 BCE to 1500 CE. The Maya were known for their advanced knowledge of astronomy, mathematics, and engineering, and built elaborate cities with pyramids, temples, and palaces.\n3. Aztecs: The Aztecs emerged in the 14th century CE and established their capital, Tenochtitlán (modern-day Mexico City), in the Valley of Mexico. They built a vast empire that stretched across much of central Mexico, and were known for their advanced agriculture, architecture, and art.\n4. Toltecs: The Toltecs were a pre-Aztec civilization that flourished in central Mexico from around 750 to 1170 CE. They are known for their sophisticated art, architecture, and religious practices, and are believed to have been the ancestors of the Aztecs.\n5. Zapotecs: The Zapotecs were a major civilization in the southern part of Mexico, particularly in the state of Oaxaca, from around 1000 BCE to 500 CE. They are known for their impressive architecture, including the ancient city of Monte Albán, and their complex system of writing and governance.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many pre-Columbian civilizations that existed in Mexico before the arrival of the Spanish.

He was born into a family of weavers and began working in the textile industry at a young age. In 1764, he invented the Spinning Jenny, which revolutionized the textile industry by allowing multiple spindles to be rotated by a single handle, greatly increasing the speed and efficiency of spinning cotton and wool.\nThe Spinning Jenny consisted of a frame with multiple spindles mounted on it, connected by a central shaft. The operator would turn a handle, which would rotate all the spindles simultaneously, allowing for much faster spinning than was possible with a single spindle.\nHargreaves' invention quickly gained popularity in the textile industry, and the Spinning Jenny became a common sight in mills and workshops throughout England and beyond. It played a key role in the Industrial Revolution, as it allowed for mass production of textiles and helped to transform the industry from a cottage-based, labor-intensive process to one that was more mechanized and efficient.\nHargreaves' invention was not without controversy, however. Some textile workers were concerned that the Spinning Jenny would lead to job losses, as it could be operated by a single person rather than the many required to operate traditional spinning wheels. Despite these concerns, the Spinning Jenny remained an important innovation in the textile industry and helped to pave the way for further technological advancements in the field.", "known": true}

There is no inherent difference in the way boys and girls write due to their gender. Handwriting is a complex skill that is influenced by a variety of factors, including fine motor skills, cognitive development, and cultural and environmental influences.\nResearch has shown that there is more variation within each gender than between genders when it comes to handwriting style. For example, a study published in the Journal of Hand Therapy found that there was little to no difference in the handwriting characteristics of boys and girls aged 5-12 years old.\nIt's important to recognize that these stereotypes can have negative consequences, such as reinforcing gender roles and limiting the potential of children based on their gender.

Because the light is reflected, rather than direct, the inverse square law does not apply, and the intensity of the light remains relatively constant, regardless of the distance between your body and the mirror.\nThis is why you see a consistent image of yourself in the mirror, regardless of how far away you are from it. The image you see in the mirror is not a direct reflection of your body, but rather a reflected image that appears to be the same size and shape as your body, even if you are standing far away from the mirror.\nIt's worth noting that this effect is not limited to mirrors. Any time you see an image of yourself in a reflective surface, such as a window or a still body of water, the same principles of light reflection apply, and you will see a consistent image of yourself, regardless of the distance between you and the reflective surface.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.2492753623188406, "rouge2": 0.07580174927113703, "rougeL": 0.17391304347826086, "rougeLsum": 0.18550724637681162}, "known": true}

Here is a brief overview of his presidency:\nHerbert Hoover was born on August 10, 1874, in West Branch, Iowa. He was a successful mining engineer, humanitarian, and politician before being elected as the 31st President of the United States in 1928. Hoover won the election by a landslide, defeating Democratic candidate Al Smith, with 444 electoral votes to Smith's 87.\nHoover took office on March 4, 1929, and his presidency was marked by a number of significant events, including the stock market crash of 1929, which occurred just months after he took office. The crash, also known as Black Tuesday, occurred on October 29, 1929, and marked the beginning of the Great Depression, a severe economic downturn that lasted for over a decade.\nDespite the challenges posed by the Great Depression, Hoover remained committed to his free-market policies and refused to implement policies that he believed would exacerbate the economic crisis. He instead focused on implementing a series of small-scale relief programs, such as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which provided loans to struggling businesses and farmers.\nHoover's presidency was also marked by foreign policy challenges, including the rise of fascist dictators in Europe and the increasing tensions between the United States and Japan. He played a key role in negotiating a peaceful resolution to the Crisis of the Ruhr, a conflict between Germany and France over the control of the Ruhr Valley.\nDespite his efforts to address the economic crisis, Hoover's popularity declined significantly during his presidency, due in part to his inability to effectively address the Great Depression. He lost the 1932 presidential election to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who ran on a platform of radical economic reform and implemented a series of New Deal programs to address the economic crisis.\nOverall, Herbert Hoover's presidency was marked by significant economic challenges, including the Great Depression, and his inability to effectively address these challenges contributed to his loss of popularity and his", "known": false}

These papers have been accused of promoting hate speech and discrimination against various groups, including ethnic minorities, women, and the LGBTQ+ community.\nThe backlash against these newspapers has been fueled by a number of factors, including:\n1. Rise of hate speech: In recent years, there has been a rise in hate speech and discrimination against marginalized groups in the UK, and some have argued that the media has played a role in perpetuating this trend.\n2. Lack of diversity: Many of the newspapers involved in the scandal have been criticized for lacking diversity in their editorial teams, which has led to a lack of diverse perspectives and voices in their reporting.\n3. Political polarization: The UK has become increasingly politically polarized, with some newspapers taking a clear stance on the political right or left. This has led to a lack of nuance and balance in their reporting, and has contributed to the spread of hate speech and misinformation.\n4. Advertiser boycotts: Several major advertisers have pulled their ads from the newspapers involved in the scandal, citing concerns over the offensive content and the potential damage to their brands. This has had a significant financial impact on the newspapers, as advertising revenue is a major source of income for them.\n5. Public pressure: The public has been vocal in its criticism of the newspapers involved in the scandal, with many calling for greater accountability and responsibility in the media.

Simplicity: A flag's primary purpose is to be easily recognizable and identifiable from a distance. Including the name of the country would add complexity and make the flag more difficult to recognize.\n2. Space constraints: Flags are typically small, measuring anywhere from a few inches to a few feet in length. There simply isn't enough space to include the name of the country on a flag without making it too cluttered or difficult to read.\n3. Visual identity: A flag is meant to be a visual representation of a country's identity, rather than a text-based representation. The colors, symbols, and patterns used on a flag are intended to convey the country's culture, history, and values, rather than its name.\n4. Uniformity: If national flags were required to display the name of the country, it could lead to confusion and inconsistency, particularly for countries with similar names or similar flag designs. For example, there are several countries with the word \"Canada\" in their name, and including the name on the flag could make it difficult to tell them apart.\n5. Tradition: Many national flags have been designed over time, and the design has become an integral part of the country's identity.

Here are some possible factors that may have contributed to the shift away from corporal punishment and towards more lenient sentences:\n1. Human rights and dignity: Many people believe that mutilating or physically harming criminals is a violation of their human rights and dignity. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948, states that \"no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\"\n2. Rehabilitation and restorative justice: There is a growing recognition that the primary goal of the criminal justice system should be rehabilitation rather than punishment. This approach emphasizes helping offenders to address the underlying causes of their behavior and become productive members of society. Lenient sentences may be seen as a way to encourage offenders to participate in rehabilitation programs and make amends to their victims.\n3. Cost-benefit analysis: Implementing corporal punishment can be expensive and may not be cost-effective compared to other forms of punishment. For example, mutilating a criminal may require extensive medical care and ongoing monitoring, which can be expensive and resource-intensive. In contrast, more lenient sentences may be less expensive and allow for more efficient use of resources.\n4. Changing societal values: Attitudes towards crime and punishment have evolved over time, reflecting changing social values and norms. As society becomes more compassionate and focused on rehabilitation, there may be less support for harsh punishments like corporal punishment.\n5. Legal and constitutional developments: Changes in laws and constitutions may have limited the use of corporal punishment. For example, many countries have abolished corporal punishment as a form of punishment for minors, and some have extended these protections to adults as well.\n6. Advances in psychology and criminology: Understanding of human behavior and the causes of crime has advanced significantly in recent decades. This knowledge may have led to a shift away from punitive approaches and towards more nuanced and evidence-based approaches to criminal justice.\n7. Public opinion and media influence: Public opinion and media coverage can play a significant role", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.2815884476534296, "rouge2": 0.026537997587454766, "rougeL": 0.12515042117930206, "rougeLsum": 0.2527075812274368}, "known": false}

It is said that he was cursed by a witch or a sea goddess after he ignored her warnings not to sail too close to the Cape of Good Hope. As a result, his ship, the Flying Dutchman, was doomed to sail the seas forever, never able to find peace or rest.\nCaptain Van der Decken is often depicted as a tall, imposing figure with a long white beard and a fierce expression. He is said to be seen on the deck of the Flying Dutchman, directing his crew and cursing the sea with his fierce anger and frustration.

The split was the result of a series of theological and political differences that had been developing over several centuries.\nHere are some key events that led to the schism:\n1. The Filioque Controversy: The Eastern Orthodox Church believed that the Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and the Son (Filioque), while the Roman Catholic Church taught that the Holy Spirit proceeds only from the Father (Monophysite). This difference in theology led to a significant rift between the two churches.\n2. Papal Infallibility: The Roman Catholic Church began to assert the doctrine of papal infallibility in the 11th century, which the Eastern Orthodox Church rejected. The Eastern Orthodox Church believed that the Pope did not have the authority to speak ex cathedra (in infallible terms) on matters of faith and practice.\n3. Western Influence: The Roman Catholic Church began to assert its influence over the Eastern Orthodox Church through political means, such as the Crusades and the establishment of Latin-speaking bishoprics in the East. This led to a sense of cultural and religious imperialism among the Eastern Orthodox, who felt that their traditions and practices were being threatened.\n4. The Great Schism: In 1054 AD, the final straw came when the Pope of Rome, Leo IX, excommunicated the Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Cerularius. This led to a formal split between the two churches, with each side anathematizing the other.\nThe consequences of the Great Schism were far-reaching. The Eastern Orthodox Church remained independent of Roman Catholic influence, developing its own distinct traditions and practices. The Roman Catholic Church, on the other hand, continued to assert its authority over the Western Christian world, leading to the development of Protestantism in the 16th century as a reaction against what was seen as the corruption and abuses of the Roman Catholic Church.\nDespite the schism, there have been numerous attempts at reconciliation between the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church.

He was born in Cuttack, Odisha, India in 1897 and was educated in India and England. Bose was a key figure in the Indian National Congress and was known for his advocacy of armed struggle against British rule.\nIn his book, \"The Indian Struggle,\" published in 1921, Bose referred to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 as the \"First War of Indian Independence.\" This term was later popularized by other Indian nationalist leaders, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, who saw the uprising as a significant milestone in the struggle for Indian independence.\nBose's use of the term \"First War of Indian Independence\" was intended to emphasize the continuity of the Indian independence movement across generations and to highlight the fact that the struggle for freedom had been ongoing since the mid-19th century. By referring to the uprising of 1857 as the \"first war,\" Bose was able to situate the movement within a broader historical context and to emphasize its importance as a precursor to the larger struggle for independence that would eventually culminate in 1947.\nOverall, while the term \"First War of Indian Independence\" was not widely used until the early 20th century, it has since become a widely accepted and important part of Indian nationalist discourse, recognizing the significance of the uprising of 1857 as a pivotal moment in the struggle for Indian independence.", "known": false}

Symbolism: Black-eyed peas are also seen as a symbol of unity and togetherness, as they are often cooked in large pots and shared with family and friends. This tradition is believed to bring people closer together and promote harmony in the coming year.\n4. New Year's resolutions: Eating black-eyed peas on New Year's Day is also seen as a way to start the new year off on a positive note. The peas are believed to represent the idea of \"eating your greens,\" which is a common New Year's resolution.\n5. Historical significance: In some cultures, black-eyed peas are believed to have been eaten by enslaved Africans in the Americas, who would use them as a substitute for their traditional foods during the holiday season. This history adds a deeper meaning to the tradition of eating black-eyed peas on New Year's Day.\nOverall, the tradition of eating black-eyed peas on New Year's Day is a cultural and historical one that has been passed down through generations. While there are many different reasons why people eat black-eyed peas on New Year's Day, the most common reason is to bring good luck and prosperity in the coming year.", "known": false}

Here are some key milestones in the history of using chlorine solution for hand decontamination:\n1. Early 20th century: The use of chlorine solution for hand decontamination was first introduced in the early 20th century by Dr. Joseph Lawrence, a British physician and microbiologist. Lawrence observed that chlorine solution could effectively kill bacteria on surfaces and proposed its use for hand decontamination in hospitals.\n2. 1930s: The use of chlorine solution for hand decontamination became more widespread in the 1930s, particularly in the United States. The U.S. Public Health Service recommended the use of chlorine solution for hand decontamination in hospitals during the Great Depression.\n3. 1940s: During World War II, the use of chlorine solution for hand decontamination became even more common in healthcare settings. The U.S. military used chlorine solution to decontaminate the hands of soldiers and medical personnel in the field.\n4. 1950s: In the 1950s, the use of chlorine solution for hand decontamination became more formalized in healthcare settings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began to recommend the use of chlorine solution for hand decontamination in hospitals and other healthcare facilities.\n5. 1980s: In the 1980s, the use of chlorine solution for hand decontamination became more sophisticated with the development of automated hand sanitizing systems. These systems used chlorine-based hand sanitizers and were designed to be more efficient and effective than manual hand washing with soap and water.\n6. Present day: Today, chlorine solution remains a common method for hand decontamination in healthcare settings. However, there is growing interest in alternative methods of hand decontamination, such as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, due to concerns about the potential toxicity of chlorine and the effectiveness of these alternatives.\nOver", "known": false}

Habituation: When we are repeatedly exposed to a particular smell, our brain can become accustomed to it and stop paying attention to it. This is known as habituation.\n2. Attention allocation: Our brains have limited capacity for processing sensory information, so we may prioritize other sensory inputs, such as visual or auditory cues, over olfactory ones.\n3. Olfactory fatigue: Prolonged exposure to strong or unpleasant smells can lead to olfactory fatigue, which can cause us to become less sensitive to the smell over time.\n4. Genetic differences: Some people may be more sensitive to certain smells due to genetic differences in their olfactory system.\n5. Age-related changes: As we age, our sense of smell can decline, leading to a decrease in sensitivity to certain smells.\n6. Environmental factors: Exposure to pollutants, allergens, or other environmental toxins can damage the olfactory system and lead to a decrease in smell sensitivity.\n7. Psychological factors: Stress, anxiety, or other psychological conditions can also affect our ability to perceive and process smells.\n8. Lack of interest: If we are not interested in a particular smell or do not associate it with anything important, we may be less likely to pay attention to it.\n9. Cultural influences: Different cultures may have different preferences and expectations when it comes to smells, and this can affect how we perceive and respond to them.\n10.

Here are some of the main factors that influence the exchange rate:\n1. Supply and Demand: The exchange rate is determined by the interaction of buyers and sellers in the foreign exchange market. When there is a high demand for a currency, its value tends to appreciate, and when there is a low demand, its value tends to depreciate.\n2. Interest Rates: The level of interest rates in a country can also affect the exchange rate. Higher interest rates in one country can attract foreign investors, causing the currency to appreciate.\n3. Inflation: A country with high inflation will see its currency depreciate, as investors will demand a higher exchange rate to compensate for the loss of purchasing power.\n4. Political Stability: Political instability or uncertainty can lead to a depreciation of a currency, as investors become risk-averse and demand a higher exchange rate to compensate for the increased risk.\n5. Economic Indicators: Economic indicators such as GDP, trade balances, and current account balances can also influence the exchange rate. A country with a strong economy and a large trade surplus will tend to have a stronger currency.\n6. Central Bank Policies: Central banks can also influence the exchange rate through their monetary policies. For example, a central bank may intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the exchange rate or to manage inflation.\n7. Market Sentiment: Market sentiment, or the overall attitude of investors towards a particular currency, can also influence the exchange rate. For example, if investors are optimistic about a country's economic prospects, they may buy that country's currency, causing it to appreciate.\n8. Currency Hedging: Companies that conduct business in multiple countries may use currency hedging strategies to manage exchange rate risks. This can involve buying and selling currencies to lock in exchange rates and protect against potential losses.\n9. International Trade: The exchange rate can also be influenced by international trade agreements and the balance of trade between countries. For example, a country with a large trade deficit may see its currency depreciate as investors become less confident in its economy.\n10.

Howard Gardner: Gardner (1983) argued that the two-factor theory oversimplifies the complexity of human cognition and ignores the role of motivation and emotion in cognitive processing. He proposed a more comprehensive theory of multiple intelligences that includes nine different types of intelligence.\n2. David Sternberg: Sternberg (1997) criticized the two-factor theory for neglecting the role of context and culture in shaping cognitive abilities. He proposed a more nuanced view of intelligence that takes into account the dynamic interplay between cognitive and contextual factors.\n3. Robert Thorndike: Thorndike (1997) argued that the two-factor theory is too simplistic and does not account for the full range of cognitive abilities. He proposed a more complex model of intelligence that includes multiple components and subcomponents.\n4. Elizabeth Spelke: Spelke (1995) argued that the two-factor theory ignores the role of innate knowledge and abilities in shaping cognitive development. She proposed a more biologically based view of intelligence that emphasizes the importance of innate factors.\n5. Michael Cole: Cole (1996) argued that the two-factor theory ignores the role of social and cultural factors in shaping cognitive development. He proposed a more sociocultural view of intelligence that emphasizes the importance of social and cultural context in shaping cognitive abilities.\n6. David Geary: Geary (1999) argued that the two-factor theory ignores the role of genetics and evolution in shaping cognitive abilities. He proposed a more evolutionary view of intelligence that emphasizes the importance of genetic and environmental factors in shaping cognitive development.\n7. Mark Runco: Runco (2001) argued that the two-factor theory ignores the role of creativity and motivation in shaping cognitive abilities.

Cache Clearing: When you restart your router, it clears its cache, which can help improve internet speed. The cache stores data about websites you've visited, but it can become bloated over time, leading to slower speeds.\n2. Network Congestion: When you restart your router, it can help clear up network congestion caused by too many devices connected to the network. This can help improve internet speeds by reducing the amount of data traffic on the network.\n3. Firmware Updates: Restarting your router can install any firmware updates that may have been applied, which can improve its performance and fix any bugs that may be causing slow speeds.\n4. Resetting Settings: Restarting your router can reset its settings to their default values, which can help resolve issues with custom settings that may be causing slow speeds.\n5. Interference: Restarting your router can help reduce interference from other devices in your home or nearby that may be causing slow speeds. This is especially true if you live in an area with a lot of wireless devices, such as cordless phones, baby monitors, and microwaves.\n6. ISP Issues: Sometimes, internet service providers (ISPs) experience technical difficulties that can cause slow speeds.

Here are some key points to know about these monitors:\n1. Fetal Heart Rate Monitors:\na. Types: There are two main types of fetal heart rate monitors:\ni. External fetal heart rate monitors: These monitors use electrodes placed on the mother's abdomen to measure the baby's heart rate. They provide real-time data and can detect any changes in the baby's heart rate.\nii. Internal fetal heart rate monitors: These monitors are inserted into the uterus through the cervix to measure the baby's heart rate directly. They provide more accurate readings but are less commonly used.\nb. Purpose: The primary purpose of fetal heart rate monitors is to:\ni. Detect any abnormalities in the baby's heart rate, such as bradycardia (slow heart rate) or tachycardia (fast heart rate).\nii. Monitor the baby's well-being during labor and delivery.\niii. Provide real-time data to healthcare providers to make informed decisions about the delivery process.\n2. Cervix Monitors:\na. Types: There are two main types of cervix monitors:\ni. Cervical dilatation monitors: These monitors measure the size of the cervix during labor to determine how far the cervix has dilated.\nii. Cervical station monitors: These monitors measure the position of the cervix in relation to the opening of the uterus.\nb. Purpose: The primary purpose of cervix monitors is to:\ni. Assess the progress of labor and determine when the cervix is ready for delivery.\nii. Identify any complications, such as a slow or stalled labor, that may require interventions.\niii. Provide real-time data to healthcare providers to make informed decisions about the delivery process.\n3. How they work:\na. Fetal Heart Rate Monitors:\ni.

However, accidents can still happen, and players may experience fear or discomfort when facing this risk. Here are some reasons why baseball players may not be afraid of being hit in the face:\n1. Training and experience: Professional baseball players have undergone extensive training and have years of experience playing the game. They have learned how to position themselves, track the ball, and react quickly to avoid being hit. Their training and experience help them develop muscle memory and instincts that allow them to respond to potential threats without hesitation.\n2. Protective gear: Baseball players wear protective gear such as helmets, face masks, and eye protection to minimize the risk of injury. These devices can help absorb or deflect impact, reducing the likelihood of serious injury. While no gear can completely eliminate the risk of injury, the use of protective equipment can provide a sense of security and confidence for players.\n3. Focus on the game: During a game, players are focused on the action unfolding on the field. They are concentrating on their own performance, the strategies of their team, and the opposition. This intense focus can help players tune out distractions, including the possibility of being hit in the face. While they may be aware of the risk, they prioritize their gameplay over any fear or anxiety.\n4. Mental preparation: Professional baseball players often undergo mental preparation techniques to manage their nerves and stay focused during games. This can include visualization exercises, breathing techniques, and positive self-talk. By developing mental strategies to cope with pressure and uncertainty, players can reduce their fear of being hit in the face and maintain their composure on the field.\n5. Trust in teammates: In baseball, players rely on their teammates to cover them and provide support. If a player is hit in the face, their teammates may be able to help them or provide protection. This trust in their teammates can help players feel more secure and less anxious about the risk of injury.\n6. Acceptance of risk: Baseball is a contact sport, and players understand that there are risks involved. While they may fear being hit in the face, they also accept that this", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.34710743801652894, "rouge2": 0.05801104972375691, "rougeL": 0.15151515151515152, "rougeLsum": 0.30027548209366395}, "known": true}

However, the new empire faced many challenges, including political instability, economic problems, and conflicts with indigenous peoples.\nIn 1889, a military coup led by Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca resulted in the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the First Brazilian Republic. The new republic was faced with the task of building a stable and modern nation-state, and it took several decades for Brazil to consolidate its democratic institutions and establish itself as a major player in international affairs.", "known": true}

{"id": "15k2ib", "output": [{"answer": "It's not extortion... it's protectionist agricultural policy and the agricultural lobby (including [American Farmland Trust](_URL_4_)). Every five years Congress is expected to pass another temporary law regarding agricultural policy known as the [farm bill](_URL_5_). Our current bill, the [Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008](_URL_1_) was passed despite Bush's veto in 2008.\n\nThe pentannual farm bill basically allows short-term control over the policies implemented by previous agricultural legislation dating back to even the Dust Bowl and Great Depression. For the most part, these are aimed at maintaining \"farm income stabilization\" and maintaining stable cheap prices while helping farmers stay afloat, despite intense international competition (see \"protectionism\").\n\nIn particular, the Agricultural Act of 1949 (an example of *permanent* agricultural legislation) implemented something known as the [Milk (now Dairy Product) Price Support Program](_URL_0_), which put into place provisions for a a type of *price support* in which the government agrees to purchase enough milk to reach some set goal so that agricultural processors and vendors reach a target revenue, allowing them to pay comfortable wages for farmers.\n\nThe goal was to allow farmers to be able to make a high income and shield them from sources of volatility (like natural disasters). The original 1949 legislation agreed to keep the prices for milk products between 75-90% [parity](_URL_3_), so that farming would remain profitable and we could rely on our domestic agricultural sector in the future. The [idea behind parity](_URL_7_) in this context dates back to the era before World War I, thanks to the earlier statisticians who recorded data on the prices of agricultural goods and other commodities, and centers on the idea of \"fair\" exchange value:\n > “Parity”, as ap-plied to income from any agricultural commodity for any year, shall be that gross income for such year as the average gross income from such commodity for the preceding 10 calendar years bears to the average gross income from agriculture for such 10 calendar years.\n\nNow, in October 21, 1981, the farm bill known as the [Agricultural and Food Act of 1981](_URL_6_) switched to a system in which Congress began to target specific price levels or rely on expectations for surplus, instead, overriding provisions of the 1949 law. The 2008 Farm Bill was the first to explicitly implement price floors on dairy products rather than merely milk:\n > * For cheddar cheese in blocks, not less than $1.13 per pound;\n* For cheddar cheese in barrels, not less than $1.10 per pound;\n* For butter, not less than $1.05 per pound and;\n* For nonfat dry milk, not less than $0.80 per pound.\n\nNow, the problem is that these price floors turn out to be much lower than those found using the 1949 parity provisions thanks to economic growth. Unfortunately, the 2008 farm bill expires in 3 days, on the 31st, and unless a 2012 farm bill emerges quickly, these price supports will revert and the government will find itself keeping milk at a very high cost, crowding-out consumers.\n\n[This is not the only reason why the farm bill is needed, however.](_URL_2_)", "meta": {"score": 5}}], "question": "the upcoming \"dairy crisis\"...Is the Dept of Agriculture really \"required\" to purchase milk from farmers?

Our current bill, the [Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008](_URL_1_) was passed despite Bush's veto in 2008.\n\nThe pentannual farm bill basically allows short-term control over the policies implemented by previous agricultural legislation dating back to even the Dust Bowl and Great Depression. For the most part, these are aimed at maintaining \"farm income stabilization\" and maintaining stable cheap prices while helping farmers stay afloat, despite intense international competition (see \"protectionism\").\n\nIn particular, the Agricultural Act of 1949 (an example of *permanent* agricultural legislation) implemented something known as the [Milk (now Dairy Product) Price Support Program](_URL_0_), which put into place provisions for a a type of *price support* in which the government agrees to purchase enough milk to reach some set goal so that agricultural processors and vendors reach a target revenue, allowing them to pay comfortable wages for farmers.\n\nThe goal was to allow farmers to be able to make a high income and shield them from sources of volatility (like natural disasters). The original 1949 legislation agreed to keep the prices for milk products between 75-90% [parity](_URL_3_), so that farming would remain profitable and we could rely on our domestic agricultural sector in the future. The [idea behind parity](_URL_7_) in this context dates back to the era before World War I, thanks to the earlier statisticians who recorded data on the prices of agricultural goods and other commodities, and centers on the idea of \"fair\" exchange value:\n > “Parity”, as ap-plied to income from any agricultural commodity for any year, shall be that gross income for such year as the average gross income from such commodity for the preceding 10 calendar years bears to the average gross income from agriculture for such 10 calendar years.\n\nNow, in October 21, 1981, the farm bill known as the [Agricultural and Food Act of 1981](_URL_6_) switched to a system in which Congress began to target specific price levels or rely on expectations for surplus, instead, overriding provisions of the 1949 law. The 2008 Farm Bill was the first to explicitly implement price floors on dairy products rather than merely milk:\n > * For cheddar cheese in blocks, not less than $1.13 per pound;\n* For cheddar cheese in barrels, not less than $1.10 per pound;\n* For butter, not less than $1.05 per pound and;\n* For nonfat dry milk, not less than $0.80 per pound.\n\nNow, the problem is that these price floors turn out to be much lower than those found using the 1949 parity provisions thanks to economic growth. Unfortunately, the 2008 farm bill expires in 3 days, on the 31st, and unless a 2012 farm bill emerges quickly, these price supports will revert and the government will find itself keeping milk at a very high cost, crowding-out consumers.\n\n[This is not the only reason why the farm bill is needed, however.](_URL_2_)"], "llama7b_without_search_answer": " The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) does not have a legal requirement to purchase milk directly from farmers. However, the USDA does have several programs that provide support to dairy farmers through various means, including purchasing milk and dairy products for distribution to food banks, schools, and other organizations.\nOne such program is the Dairy Donation Program, which is administered by the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). Under this program, the USDA purchases milk and other dairy products from dairy farmers and donates them to food banks, schools, and other organizations that serve low-income individuals and families. The goal of the program is to help provide access to nutritious food for those in need while also supporting dairy farmers who may be experiencing economic difficulties.\nAnother program that provides support to dairy farmers is the Dairy Margin Protection Program (DMPP), which was established in 2014 as part of the Farm Bill. The DMPP provides financial assistance to dairy farmers when the margin (the difference between the price of milk and the cost of producing it) falls below a certain threshold. The program is designed to help dairy farmers manage risk and maintain their profitability during times of market volatility.\nIn addition to these programs, the USDA also provides support to dairy farmers through other means, such as through the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), which provides funding for marketing and promotion of dairy products, and through the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), which provides technical and financial assistance to dairy farmers to help them implement conservation practices on their farms.\nIt's worth noting that while the USDA does not have a legal requirement to purchase milk directly from farmers, the agency does have a statutory mandate to ensure that the nation's food supply is adequate and available to meet consumer demand. This includes working to support dairy farmers and ensuring that they have the resources they need to produce safe and nutritious milk.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.338389731621937, "rouge2": 0.03274853801169591, "rougeL": 0.1353558926487748, "rougeLsum": 0.2823803967327888}, "known": false}

Here are some key points to consider:\n1. The Earth's interior: The Earth has a molten core with a temperature of around 6,000°C (10,800°F). The core is surrounded by a mantle of hot, viscous rock that can flow like a liquid. The mantle is divided into the upper mantle and the lower mantle, with the boundary between them located at a depth of around 400 km (250 miles).\n2. Plate tectonics: The Earth's crust is broken up into several large plates that float on the more fluid mantle below. These plates are in constant motion, moving at a rate of a few centimeters per year. This movement is responsible for phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and the creation of mountain ranges.\n3. Gravity: The force of gravity pulls objects towards the center of the Earth. The strength of this force depends on the distance between an object and the center of the Earth, as well as the mass of the Earth itself. The deeper you go into the Earth, the stronger the gravitational pull becomes.\n4. Escape velocity: The escape velocity from the Earth is the speed at which an object would need to travel to escape the Earth's gravitational pull. This velocity increases with distance from the center of the Earth, and at the surface it is around 11.2 km/s (7 miles/s). This means that if you were to fall through the Earth, you would need to travel at least this fast to escape.\n5. Time dilation: As you fall through the Earth, time would appear to slow down due to the effects of relativity. This means that the longer you fall, the slower time would pass. This effect would become more pronounced as you approach the center of the Earth.\n6. Temperature: As you fall through the Earth, the temperature would decrease due to the increasing distance from the surface. At the center of the Earth, the temperature is estimated to be around 5,000°C (9,000°F), which is hotter than the surface of the Sun.\n7.

Here's a brief history and analysis of the key contributors:\n1. Early beginnings (1960s-1980s): Professional sports leagues in the United States, such as the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL, were initially small and relatively unknown. As the popularity of sports grew, so did the salaries of athletes. In the 1960s and 1970s, the first superstars emerged, including baseball players like Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, and basketball players like Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. These athletes were able to negotiate higher salaries due to their exceptional talent and the growing demand for their services.\n2. Expansion and revenue growth (1980s-1990s): As professional sports leagues expanded and new teams were added, the overall revenue of the industry grew. This led to increased spending on player salaries, as teams sought to attract and retain top talent. The advent of cable television and the rise of sports broadcasting rights deals also contributed to the growth in player compensation, as networks were willing to pay large sums for the right to broadcast games and events.\n3. Collective bargaining and player unions (1990s-present): The formation of player unions, such as the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) and the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), gave athletes more bargaining power and helped to drive up salaries. These unions negotiated contracts with team owners and league officials, securing better pay and benefits for their members. The MLBPA, in particular, was instrumental in establishing the luxury tax, which limited the amount of money teams could spend on player salaries without facing penalties.\n4. Globalization and the rise of international markets (2000s-present): As professional sports leagues expanded into new international markets, such as China, India, and Latin America, the global reach and revenue of sports grew significantly. This led to increased competition for top talent and higher salaries, as teams sought to attract athletes from around the world.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.14832535885167464, "rouge2": 0.019230769230769232, "rougeL": 0.09569377990430622, "rougeLsum": 0.11004784688995216}, "known": false}

Here are some possible explanations:\n1. Pheromones: When you shower, you produce pheromones, which are chemical signals that can be detected by your cat's sense of smell. These pheromones can mimic the scent of a mother cat's milk, which can be particularly appealing to cats. This can lead to your cat becoming fixated on you and following you around.\n2. Warmth and comfort: Cats often associate warmth and comfort with their mothers, so when you come out of the shower feeling warm and relaxed, your cat may interpret this as a sign of potential nurturing and attention. This can lead to your cat wanting to be close to you and even grooming you.\n3. Playtime: After a shower, you may be more playful and energetic, which can be appealing to your cat. They may associate your increased energy with playtime and want to join in on the fun.\n4. Affection: Cats are highly social animals and they thrive on affection and interaction. When you shower and come out smelling fresh and clean, your cat may interpret this as a sign of affection and want to reciprocate by rubbing against you or purring.\n5. Instinctual behavior: In the wild, cats often follow their mothers or other dominant individuals to protect themselves from predators. This instinctual behavior can be triggered in your cat when they detect the scent of a dominant individual, such as you, after a shower.\n6. Attention seeking: Cats are known to seek attention from their owners, and coming out of the shower can be a great opportunity for them to get some extra attention. Your cat may associate your post-shower state with a chance to play or receive treats.\n7. Habituation: If your cat has associated showers with positive experiences, such as attention or playtime, they may become fixated on you after each shower. This can be due to a process called habituation, where your cat learns to associate the sound of the shower with positive outcomes.\nIt's important to note that every cat is different, so the reasons why your cat is obsessed with you after a shower may vary depending on their individual", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.21367521367521367, "rouge2": 0.03862660944206008, "rougeL": 0.11965811965811965, "rougeLsum": 0.1752136752136752}, "known": false}

Here are some key points about Pu-238 and its use in the Curiosity rover:\n1. What is Pu-238?\nPlutonium-238 is a radioactive isotope of plutonium, which is a synthetic element produced through the irradiation of uranium-238 with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Pu-238 has a half-life of about 87.7 years and decays through alpha emission, beta emission, and gamma emission.\n2. How does Pu-238 generate electricity?\nPu-238 is used as a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), which converts the heat generated by the decay of Pu-238 into electricity. The RTG consists of a cylindrical container filled with a mixture of Pu-238 oxide and a thermoelectric material, such as bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3). As Pu-238 decays, it emits alpha particles, which are absorbed by the thermoelectric material, causing it to heat up. This heat is then converted into an electrical voltage using thermoelectric legs.\n3. Why was Pu-238 chosen for the Curiosity rover?\nThe Curiosity rover was designed to operate for at least one Mars year (687 Earth days), and Pu-238 was chosen as the power source because it has a long half-life and can provide a steady supply of energy over a long period of time. The RTG used in the Curiosity rover is the most powerful and efficient RTG ever built, providing about 110 watts of power during the mission's early stages.\n4. Advantages of Pu-238\nPu-238 has several advantages as a power source for spacecraft:\n* Long half-life: Pu-238 has a half-life of 87.7 years, which means that it can provide a steady supply of energy over a long period of time without the need for frequent recharg", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.3682310469314079, "rouge2": 0.06159420289855073, "rougeL": 0.1588447653429603, "rougeLsum": 0.29241877256317683}, "known": true}

This requirement was intended to ensure that only adults with the maturity and financial stability to vote were allowed to participate in the electoral process.\nHowever, as society and the political landscape evolved over time, many argued that 18-year-olds were mature enough to vote and should have the right to participate in the democratic process. The movement to lower the voting age gained momentum during the Vietnam War, as many young people felt that their generation was being unfairly drafted into the military and wanted a greater say in the political decisions that affected their lives.\nThe 26th Amendment was passed by Congress with bipartisan support and was ratified by the necessary number of states after a campaign led by young people and civil rights organizations. The amendment was seen as a major victory for the youth voting rights movement and marked a significant shift in the way that young people were perceived in American politics.", "known": true}

However, the modern version of DST was first proposed in the United States in 1784 by Benjamin Franklin, who suggested that people could save candles by getting up earlier in the morning during the summer.\nThe first country to implement DST was Germany, which did so during World War I in 1916. The idea was to conserve energy by moving the clock forward one hour in the spring. Many other countries followed suit, including the United States, which adopted DST in 1918.\nIn the United States, DST was initially implemented on a trial basis in only a few states, but it was later made permanent in 1920 through the Standard Time Act. The act established that daylight saving time would begin on the last Sunday in April and end on the last Sunday in October.\nSince then, the Unites States has observed DST annually, with some minor changes to the start and end dates over the years. For example, in 1966, the Uniform Time Act established a standardized system for DST across the country, setting the start date on the last Sunday in April and the end date on the last Sunday in October.\nIt's worth noting that not all states observe DST, and some have opted out of the practice altogether.

Here are some ways that computers can choose things at random:\n1. Random number generators: Computers can use algorithms to generate random numbers, which can be used to simulate random events or make decisions randomly. For example, a computer game might use a random number generator to determine the outcome of a roll of the dice or the placement of a random power-up.\n2. Probabilistic algorithms: Some algorithms use probability theory to make decisions based on random chance. For example, a computer might use a probabilistic algorithm to decide which route to take in a maze based on the probability of finding a certain type of food at each intersection.\n3. Monte Carlo simulations: These are computer simulations that use random sampling to solve complex problems. For example, a computer might use a Monte Carlo simulation to model the behavior of a stock market, taking into account random fluctuations in the price of stocks.\n4. Machine learning: Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets and used to make predictions or decisions based on patterns in the data. In some cases, these algorithms can be used to make decisions randomly, such as when a self-driving car needs to choose between two possible routes.\n5. Hardware randomization: Some computers have specialized hardware components, such as random number generators or true random number generators (TRNG), that can produce truly random numbers. This can be used to simulate random events or make decisions randomly.\n6. Cryptography: Cryptographic algorithms often rely on randomness to ensure security. For example, a computer might use a random number generator to generate a key for encrypting data, or to generate a random nonce (number used once) to prevent replay attacks.\n7. Simulation: Computer simulations can be used to model complex systems and processes, including those that involve randomness. For example, a computer might use a simulation to model the behavior of a chemical reaction, taking into account random fluctuations in the concentrations of the reactants.\n8. Generative models: Generative models are machine learning models that can generate new data that resembles existing data. For example, a computer might use a generative model to generate new images that look like they were created by a particular artist.\n9.

The Mongols were able to quickly overcome the defenses of the cities and towns in the region, and by the end of the year, they had captured most of Transoxania.\nThe Mongol conquest of Transoxania was significant because it marked the beginning of the Mongols' expansion into Central Asia and their eventual invasion of Russia. The Mongols would go on to conquer much of the region, including the Chagatai Khanate, which covered much of modern-day Central Asia and parts of Russia.\nIt's worth noting that the exact dates of the Mongol conquest of Transoxania are not certain, as the historical records from this time period are limited.

Safety: Windows provide a clear view of the outside environment, which is essential for pilots to navigate and land the plane safely. Screen walls would obstruct their view and make it more difficult to operate the aircraft.\n2. Pressure differences: At high altitudes, there are significant pressure differences between the inside and outside of an airplane. If there were no windows, the pressure difference could cause discomfort and even injury to passengers.\n3. Noise reduction: Windows help to reduce noise levels inside the cabin by providing a barrier against engine noise and turbulence. Screen walls would not be as effective at reducing noise.\n4. Aesthetics: Many people find windows to be visually appealing and enjoyable during flight. They provide a view of the clouds, sunsets, and other scenery outside the plane.\n5. Cost: Installing screens on the inside of an airplane would add significant cost and complexity to the design and manufacturing process. It would also require specialized equipment and maintenance procedures.\n6. Limited visibility: Screens would limit the visibility of the outside environment, which could be important in certain situations such as takeoff and landing, or when flying over mountains or other terrain features.\n7. Legal requirements: There are regulatory requirements for the size and placement of windows on commercial aircraft, which would need to be considered when designing a plane with no windows.\n8. Passenger comfort: Passengers may feel claustrophobic or uncomfortable without windows, especially during long flights.\n9. Psychological factors: The presence of windows can have a calming effect on passengers, providing a sense of familiarity and connection to the outside world.\n10. Historical precedent: Airplanes have traditionally had windows, and passengers have come to expect them as a standard feature. Changing this design element would require a significant shift in passenger expectations and preferences.\n\nIt's worth noting that some experimental aircraft have been designed with non-traditional window designs, such as the \"bubble\" cockpit of the B-2 stealth bomber, or the \"flying wing\" design of the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. However, these designs are highly specialized and are not practical for commercial airliners.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.1834061135371179, "rouge2": 0.02631578947368421, "rougeL": 0.12227074235807861, "rougeLsum": 0.15283842794759828}, "known": false}

He was able to free all those countries that at the time formed one single big country known either as the La Nueva Granda or something like that. Anyways, Bolivar's dream was to keep all this countries united but as you know, that didn't happen. \nSo Chavez wants to accomplish what bolivar couldn't and reunite all these countries together. That's one of the reasons he doesn't approve the American presence on south-america. And since he can exert some sort of influence in south-america, he dares to call the  former American president a drunk on national television.\nLike it was mentioned, he's a socialist and well, he somehow supports the armed forces that are based in Colombia, aka FARC. It is believed that FARC have some training camps on Venezuelan soil.\nSorry for not explaining this like you were five, I can't see how i could :/"], "llama7b_without_search_answer": " Hugo Chávez Frías was a Venezuelan politician and military officer who served as the President of Venezuela from 1999 to 2013. Here are some key facts about him:\n1. Early life and military career: Chávez was born on July 28, 1954, in Sabaneta, Barinas, Venezuela. He came from a poor farming family and joined the Venezuelan military at the age of 17. He rose through the ranks and became a prominent figure in the Venezuelan military, eventually leading a failed coup attempt against the government of President Carlos Andrés Pérez in 1992.\n2. Political career: After his failed coup attempt, Chávez was imprisoned for several years but was released in 1994 due to health problems. He then founded the political party Movimiento Quinta República (MQR) and began campaigning for the presidency. In 1998, he won a landslide election victory and took office as President of Venezuela in 1999.\n3. Political ideology: Chávez was known for his leftist and populist political views, and he implemented policies aimed at reducing poverty and inequality in Venezuela. He also had close ties with socialist and anti-imperialist movements around the world, particularly in Latin America.\n4. Economic policies: Chávez implemented a number of economic policies aimed at reducing poverty and inequality in Venezuela, including the creation of social programs such as the Bolivarian Missions, which provided free healthcare and education to millions of Venezuelans. He also nationalized key industries, such as oil and gas, and used the country's vast oil reserves to fund social programs and infrastructure projects.\n5. Relationship with the United States: Chávez had a contentious relationship with the United States, which he accused of trying to undermine his government and exploit Venezuela's natural resources. He also sought to reduce Venezuela's dependence on the US market and increase its relations with other countries in the region, particularly China and Russia.\n6. Health issues: Chávez was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 and underwent treatment in Cuba. He died on March 5, 2013, at the age of 58, after a long battle with the disease.\n7", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.3290676416819013, "rouge2": 0.04403669724770642, "rougeL": 0.17550274223034734, "rougeLsum": 0.19012797074954296}, "known": true}

The federal government is divided into three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial, which are outlined in the United States Constitution.\nThe Executive Branch is headed by the President, who serves as both the head of state and the head of government. The President is elected through an Electoral College system, where each state has a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. The President serves a four-year term and can serve a maximum of two terms.\nThe Legislative Branch, or Congress, is composed of two houses: the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House of Representatives has 435 members, each representing a district in one of the 50 states, with the number of representatives from each state determined by the state's population. The Senate has 100 members, with each state having two senators. Members of Congress are also elected through popular vote and serve two-year terms.\nThe Judicial Branch is headed by the Supreme Court, which has the power to interpret the Constitution and federal laws. The Supreme Court has nine justices, who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\nIn addition to these federal institutions, each state has its own government, with its own governor, legislature, and judiciary. This system of federalism allows for a balance of power between the federal government and the states, and provides for a system of checks and balances to ensure that no one branch of government becomes too powerful.", "known": true}

They're all falling toward the Sun, but moving sideways fast enough to miss. That's the simplest way to explain orbits I can think of."], "llama7b_without_search_answer": " Planets do not actually \"float\" in space, but rather they are held in their orbits around the Sun (or other stars) by the gravitational force of the star. Here's a simplified explanation of how this works:\n1. Gravity: The force of gravity is what keeps planets in their orbits. The strength of the gravitational pull between two objects depends on their mass and the distance between them. The more massive the objects, the stronger the gravitational pull. The Earth, for example, has a much weaker gravitational pull than the Sun, which is why the planets orbit around it instead of being pulled towards it.\n2. Orbital velocity: The planets in our solar system are moving at very high speeds, typically around 10-30 kilometers per second (6-18 miles per second). This means that they are constantly moving away from the Sun and then falling back towards it due to the gravitational force. The orbital velocity of a planet is what keeps it in its orbit around the Sun.\n3. Kepler's laws: Johannes Kepler discovered three laws of planetary motion in the 17th century, which describe how planets move in their orbits around the Sun. According to these laws, planets move in elliptical orbits, with the Sun at one of the foci of the ellipse. The closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it moves.\n4. Gravitational potential energy: The gravitational force of the Sun on a planet is what gives it energy. As a planet moves closer to the Sun, it gains energy, which is why it speeds up. Conversely, as a planet moves away from the Sun, it loses energy and slows down.\n5. Orbital stability: The stability of a planet's orbit is determined by the balance between the gravitational force of the Sun and the planet's velocity. If a planet's velocity is too great, it will escape the gravitational pull of the Sun and leave the solar system. If its velocity is too low, it will be pulled into the Sun. The optimal velocity for a planet to maintain a stable orbit is called the \"orbital velocity.\"\nSo, to summarize, planets don't actually \"float\" in space, but are held in their orbits around the Sun by the gravitational force of the Sun.

He believed that adolescence was a representation of our human ancestors' phylogenetic shift from being primitive to being civilized. Hall's assertions stood relatively uncontested until the 1950s when psychologists such as Erik Erikson and Anna Freud started to formulate their theories about adolescence. Freud believed that the psychological disturbances associated with youth were biologically based and culturally universal while Erikson focused on the dichotomy between identity formation and role fulfillment. Even with their different theories, these three psychologists agreed that adolescence was inherently a time of disturbance and psychological confusion.

Critics of Blair's book: Many scholars and historians have criticized Blair's book for its flawed methodology, biased interpretation of evidence, and lack of academic rigor. They argue that Blair's attempts to \"prove\" the existence of a Jewish conspiracy are based on flimsy evidence and are motivated by anti-Semitic ideology.\n2. Anti-Semitic groups: Some anti-Semitic groups have embraced Blair's work and have used it to justify their own hateful beliefs and actions. However, it is important to note that Blair's ideas are not supported by mainstream scholarship or society, and his views are widely rejected as baseless and harmful.\n3. Family and friends: Blair's family and friends have been quoted as saying that he was a troubled and isolated individual who became increasingly obsessed with his conspiracy theories in the years leading up to his death. They have expressed regret and dismay at his actions and the harm they have caused to innocent people.\n4. Law enforcement: The police and other law enforcement agencies have been critical of Blair's actions, particularly his decision to target innocent people in his crusade against what he believed was a Jewish conspiracy. They have expressed concern about the potential for violence and harm that such rhetoric can inspire.\n5. Community leaders: Local community leaders and religious figures have spoken out against Blair's actions, condemning them as hate speech and urging their communities to reject such extremist ideologies. They have also expressed support for the victims of Blair's attacks and called for greater awareness and education to prevent similar incidents in the future.\nIn summary, while there may be some individuals who share Blair's views, the overwhelming majority of people have rejected his hateful and baseless conspiracy theories. His actions have caused harm to innocent people and have contributed to a climate of fear and mistrust in the community. It is important to stand against such extremism and to promote tolerance, understanding, and respect for all people.", "ppl": 4.951313018798828, "known": true}
