Here are some possible explanations:\n1. Geopolitical interests: The U.S. has strategic interests in both countries, but these interests differ in nature. In Yemen, the U.S. has historically supported the government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, which is a key ally in the region and plays a critical role in countering terrorism and preventing the spread of extremism. In Syria, the U.S. has been more focused on countering the influence of Iran and Russia, which have supported the Assad regime.\n2. Humanitarian concerns: The conflict in Yemen has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis, with widespread famine, disease, and displacement. The U.S. has provided significant humanitarian aid to Yemen and has called for an end to the fighting to avoid a catastrophic situation. In contrast, the conflict in Syria has also resulted in significant human suffering, but the U.S. has been more cautious in its response, due to concerns about the political and military dynamics in the country.\n3. Regional dynamics: The Middle East is a complex and volatile region, and the U.S. has to navigate a delicate balance of interests and alliances. In Yemen, the U.S. has traditionally maintained good relations with the government and has worked closely with Saudi Arabia, which is a key ally in the region. In Syria, the U.S. has been more critical of the Assad regime and has called for his departure, due to concerns about his government's human rights abuses and its support for terrorist groups.\n4. Ideological differences: The U.S. has historically been critical of authoritarian governments and has called for democratic reforms and human rights protections around the world. However, the U.S. has been more nuanced in its approach to Yemen, where the government is technically still in power, even though it has been weakened by the conflict. In contrast, the U.S. has been more forceful in its denunciation of the Assad regime in Syria, which has been accused of", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.25882352941176473, "rouge2": 0.04047217537942664, "rougeL": 0.14453781512605043, "rougeLsum": 0.22857142857142856}, "known": true}

The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations – Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\". The decision to send the season one winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted sarcastically that \"The terrorists have won\" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit.

This could lead to widespread protests, civil disobedience, or even violence.\n2. Legal challenges: The executive branch could face legal challenges from individuals or groups who feel their rights have been violated by the ignoring of the judiciary. These challenges could result in court orders or injunctions that could further weaken the executive branch's position.\n3.

And it's not excessive, it keeping them from having heat strokes."], "llama7b_without_search_answer": " There are a few reasons why people in war movies often don't seem to notice their excessive sweating:\n\n1. Realism: War movies are meant to be realistic depictions of historical events or hypothetical situations, and excessive sweating is a natural response to stress and exertion. By not addressing it directly, the filmmakers can create a more immersive and realistic experience for the audience.\n2. Dramatic effect: Excessive sweating can be seen as a sign of weakness or vulnerability, and by not acknowledging it, the characters in the movie can maintain their tough, stoic image. This can be particularly important in war movies where the characters are often portrayed as heroic figures who must maintain their composure in the face of danger.\n3. Practical considerations: Filming on location or in a studio can be challenging, especially when it comes to dealing with actors' sweat. It may be impractical or impossible to constantly clean up after each take, and it may be easier to simply ignore the issue rather than trying to deal with it.\n4. Character development: The lack of attention to excessive sweating can also be used to develop the characters in a subtle way. By not drawing attention to it, the audience can focus on other aspects of the character's personality or situation, such as their fear, determination, or resilience.\n5. Historical accuracy: In some cases, excessive sweating may not have been addressed in historical accounts or documentaries about the events being depicted in the war movie. By not including it in the film, the filmmakers can maintain historical accuracy while still creating an engaging and realistic portrayal of the events.\n6. Focus on the action: War movies often prioritize action and suspense over character development or realistic details like excessive sweating. By focusing on the intense action scenes and plot twists, the filmmakers can create a thrilling and engaging experience for the audience without worrying too much about minor details like sweating.\n7. Audience expectations: War movies often have certain conventions that audiences expect to see, such as heroic acts of bravery, intense combat scenes, and dramatic moments of sacrifice.

Here are some of the most common number systems used in graphics cards:\n1. Single Precision (float32): This is the most common number system used in graphics cards, particularly for tasks such as rendering 3D graphics, physics simulations, and video encoding. Single precision floating-point numbers are represented as 32-bit binary numbers, with a mantissa of 23 bits and an exponent of 8 bits. This allows for a wide range of values to be represented, but with less precision than double precision.\n2. Double Precision (float64): Double precision floating-point numbers are used for tasks that require higher precision than single precision, such as scientific simulations, machine learning, and high-resolution video editing. Double precision numbers are represented as 64-bit binary numbers, with a mantissa of 53 bits and an exponent of 11 bits. This provides much higher precision than single precision, but at the cost of slower performance.\n3. Half Precision (float16): Half precision floating-point numbers are used for tasks that require a balance between precision and performance, such as ray tracing, global illumination, and real-time rendering. Half precision numbers are represented as 16-bit binary numbers, with a mantissa of 11 bits and an exponent of 5 bits. This provides a good balance between precision and performance, but with less precision than double precision.\n4. Integer: Some graphics cards also use integer arithmetic for certain tasks, such as texture manipulation and pixel processing. Integers are represented as 32-bit or 64-bit binary numbers, with no fractional part. This can provide faster performance than floating-point arithmetic, but with less precision.\n5. Vector Quantization: Some graphics cards use vector quantization to compress and decompress large datasets, such as textures and 3D models. Vector quantization works by representing a set of values as a vector of fixed length, with each element of the vector representing a possible value. This can provide significant compression gains, but with some loss of precision.\n6. Huffman Coding: Some graphics cards use Huffman coding to compress and decompress data, such as texture maps and 3D models.

It is composed of a mixture of fluids from the testicles, epididymis, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and urethra. When semen is exposed to hot water, it can undergo a series of changes in its consistency and texture, leading to its hardening.\nThere are several reasons why semen turns hard when exposed to hot water:\n1. pH changes: Semen has a slightly alkaline pH, ranging from 7.2 to 8.0. When exposed to hot water, the pH of the semen can shift towards a more alkaline range, causing it to become more viscous and harder.\n2. Protein denaturation: Semen contains proteins such as albumin, globulin, and fibrinogen, which are responsible for its structure and function. When exposed to hot water, these proteins can denature, or unwind, and form new bonds with each other, leading to a more rigid structure.\n3. Water evaporation: As hot water is applied to semen, the water molecules in the semen begin to evaporate, causing the remaining water to become more concentrated. This concentration can lead to a higher viscosity and harder consistency.\n4. Temperature-dependent viscosity: The viscosity of semen is temperature-dependent, meaning that it becomes more viscous at lower temperatures and less viscous at higher temperatures. When semen is exposed to hot water, its viscosity increases, making it harder.\n5. Muscle contractions: During sexual arousal, the muscles in the pelvic area, particularly the bulbocavernosus and ischiocavernosus muscles, contract and relax in a rhythmic manner. These muscle contractions can help to push the semen through the urethra and out of the body, but they can also contribute to the hardening of the semen.\nIt's worth noting that the exact mechanisms behind semen hardening can vary depending on individual factors, such as the temperature and duration of exposure to hot water, as well as the individual's overall health and semen quality.

Increased foreign exchange earnings: Tax havens often have a strong financial sector and a well-developed infrastructure, which attracts foreign investment and generates foreign exchange earnings for the country.\n2. Job creation: The financial sector in tax havens creates jobs, both directly and indirectly, through the provision of financial services such as banking, investment management, and accounting.\n3.

Reputation and prestige: Tax havens are often associated with wealth, secrecy, and exclusivity, which can enhance a country's reputation and prestige on the global stage.\n5. Reduced tax revenue for other countries: By storing their money in tax havens, wealthy individuals and companies can reduce their tax liability in their home countries, which can result in lost tax revenue for those countries.\n6. Increased financial stability: Tax havens often have strict financial regulations and oversight, which can help to stabilize the financial system and prevent financial crises.\n7. Access to international markets: Tax havens often have well-developed financial markets and connections to international markets, which can provide wealthy individuals and companies with access to a wide range of investment opportunities.\n8. Confidentiality and privacy: Tax havens often offer confidentiality and privacy laws, which can appeal to wealthy individuals and companies who value their privacy and wish to keep their financial affairs discreet.\n9.

Here are some reasons why credit is necessary:\n1. Financing large purchases: Credit allows individuals and businesses to make large purchases, such as buying a car or a home, without having to pay the full amount upfront. This can help people and businesses acquire assets that they might not be able to afford otherwise.\n2. Managing cash flow: Credit can help individuals and businesses manage their cash flow by allowing them to delay payment for certain expenses until a later date. For example, a business may use credit to purchase inventory or supplies without having to pay for them immediately.\n3. Building credit history: Using credit responsibly can help individuals and businesses build a positive credit history, which can make it easier to obtain credit in the future. A good credit history can also lead to lower interest rates and better loan terms.\n4. Emergency funding: Credit can provide a safety net in case of unexpected expenses or emergencies. For example, a credit card can be used to cover unexpected medical bills or car repairs.\n5. Investment opportunities: Credit can be used to invest in assets that have the potential to increase in value over time, such as stocks or real estate. By using credit to finance these investments, individuals and businesses can potentially earn a return on their investment.\n6. Improving financial flexibility: Credit can provide individuals and businesses with more flexibility in managing their finances. For example, a credit card can be used to pay for travel expenses or to cover unexpected expenses, without having to withdraw cash from an ATM.\n7. Reducing financial risk: Credit can help reduce financial risk by allowing individuals and businesses to diversify their investments and spread out their payments over time. For example, a business may use credit to finance a new product line, reducing the risk of default by spreading out the payments over several years.\n8. Encouraging economic growth: Credit can play a role in stimulating economic growth by providing individuals and businesses with the capital they need to invest in new projects and initiatives.

Here are some possible reasons why:\n1. Personal space and privacy: Some people may feel that PDAs are an invasion of their personal space and privacy. They may prefer to keep their romantic or intimate moments private, rather than sharing them with a larger audience.\n2. Social norms and cultural values: In some cultures or social settings, PDAs are not considered appropriate or are seen as disruptive. For example, in some workplaces or public places, it may be frowned upon to show affection in front of others.\n3. Embarrassment or shyness: Some people may feel embarrassed or shy about showing affection in public, especially if they are not used to it. They may feel self-conscious or worry about what others will think of them.\n4. Different comfort levels: People have different comfort levels when it comes to physical touch and affection. Some people may be more comfortable with it, while others may prefer to avoid it.\n5. Past experiences: Trauma or negative experiences related to physical touch or affection can make people uncomfortable with PDAs. For example, someone who has been sexually assaulted may feel uncomfortable with any kind of touch or affection from a partner.\n6. Gender roles and expectations: In some societies, there are traditional gender roles and expectations around physical touch and affection. For example, men may be expected to be more distant or reserved, while women are expected to be more affectionate.\n7. Age differences: Older generations may be less comfortable with PDAs than younger generations, who may be more accepting of physical touch and affection in public.\n8. Cultural differences: Different cultures have different norms and values around physical touch and affection. For example, in some cultures, it is common and acceptable to show affection in public, while in other cultures it is considered impolite or disrespectful.\n9. Personal beliefs and values: Some people may have personal beliefs or values that make them uncomfortable with PDAs. For example, they may believe that physical touch should be reserved for private settings, or that it is important to maintain a certain level of distance and respect in public.\n10.

Here are some reasons why bus steering wheels are typically parallel to the ground, while car steering wheels are typically perpendicular to the ground:\n\n1. Ergonomics: A parallel orientation of the steering wheel allows the driver to maintain a more neutral position in the seat, with their arms and shoulders at a comfortable angle. This can reduce fatigue and improve control of the vehicle. In contrast, a perpendicular orientation would require the driver to lean forward or backward to reach the steering wheel, which could lead to discomfort and decreased control.\n2. Safety: A parallel orientation of the steering wheel provides better visibility for the driver, as they have a clear view of the road ahead without any obstructions. This is particularly important in a bus, where the driver needs to be able to see a wide area around the vehicle to navigate safely.\n3. Space constraints: Buses are typically larger than cars and have a longer wheelbase, which means there is less space available for the steering wheel to be positioned at a perpendicular angle. By orienting the steering wheel parallel to the ground, the designers can make the most efficient use of the available space while still providing a comfortable and safe driving experience.\n4. Historical reasons: The orientation of the steering wheel has evolved over time, and the current configuration has become the standard in the automotive industry. The first cars were designed with perpendicular steering wheels, but as vehicles grew in size and complexity, the parallel orientation became more practical and comfortable for drivers.\n5. Manufacturing considerations: The manufacturing process also plays a role in the orientation of the steering wheel. It is generally easier and more cost-effective to produce a parallel-oriented steering wheel, as it requires less material and can be assembled using standard manufacturing techniques.\n\nIn summary, the orientation of the steering wheel in a bus is parallel to the ground due to a combination of ergonomic, safety, spatial, historical, and manufacturing factors. While car steering wheels are typically perpendicular to the ground, the design of buses requires a different configuration to provide a comfortable and safe driving experience.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.29838709677419356, "rouge2": 0.08097165991902834, "rougeL": 0.17338709677419353, "rougeLsum": 0.2217741935483871}, "known": true}

In 1820, when he was 14 years old, Smith said he received a vision in which he saw God the Father and Jesus Christ, who told him that all Christian denominations were wrong and that he was called to restore the true Church of Jesus Christ.\nOver the next several years, Smith had several more visions and revelations, including one in which he was visited by an angel named Moroni, who showed him the location of a set of golden plates that contained the history of an ancient people. Smith claimed that he was able to translate these plates using the Urim and Thummim, a pair of seer stones that he found with the plates. The result of this translation was the Book of Mormon, which was published in 1830.\nIn the years following the publication of the Book of Mormon, Smith established the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was initially based in Fayette, New York. The church grew rapidly, and in 1831, Smith and his followers moved to Kirtland, Ohio, where they established a community and built a temple. However, the church faced persecution and violence in both New York and Ohio, and in 1838, Smith and his followers were forced to flee to Missouri.\nIn Missouri, the church continued to grow, and in 1831, Smith dedicated the Kirtland Temple, which was seen as a sacred place where members could receive revelations and perform sacred ordinances. However, the church faced further persecution in Missouri, and in 1838, Smith was killed by a mob in Carthage, Illinois.\nAfter Smith's death, the leadership of the church was taken over by Brigham Young,", "known": true}

In this version, Baloo (voiced by Phil Harris) is portrayed as a friendly, even-tempered character who lives a responsibility-free lifestyle, seemingly far removed from the law teacher in Kipling's book. Like in the novel, Baloo is one of Mowgli's mentors and friends. Baloo is also patient and strong; his only apparent weakness is that he's ticklish. Baloo is initially opposed to bringing Mowgli to the Man Village, wanting to raise him as a son. However, when Bagheera explains that Mowgli is easy prey for Shere Khan the tiger and that he's not safe in the jungle, even with Baloo's diligent protection, Baloo realizes he has a point and agrees to tell Mowgli the difficult truth. Mowgli turns on Baloo and runs away, prompting him and Bagheera to split up and search for the boy. Baloo isn't seen again until the climax of the film, when he sees Mowgli preparing to battle Shere Khan. Baloo attempts to stop the tiger, but almost gets killed in the process. After Mowgli follows a girl named Shanti into the village and decides to stay there, Baloo is slightly disappointed, but is ultimately relieved that Mowgli is safe at last.

He sneaks into the Man Village at night after eluding Bagheera and Colonel Hathi's herd to visit Mowgli and takes him off into the jungle after being caught by Shanti, who felt bad for getting Mowgli in trouble and unknowingly saves him from Shere Khan, who also came to the village. This leads Shanti, Ranjan, and some of the other villagers to go into the jungle to search for him. Mowgli tells Baloo all about the negative aspects of the village while hiding the positive feelings he also has about the place. When Baloo makes fun of Mowgli's life in the village and scares Shanti like Mowgli asked him to, he unintentionally hurts Mowgli's feelings and annoys him. Baloo and Shanti continue to hate each other until they both say they're trying to save Mowgli from Shere Khan (who ambushed Mowgli when he went after Shanti and Ranjan to apologize) during an argument. From then on, they acknowledge one another as friends. After he, Mowgli, and Shanti trap Shere Khan under a statue on a rocky outcrop in a lava lake, Baloo understands that Mowgli's place is in the village and sadly says good-bye to him. However, it is revealed the next day that Mowgli, Shanti, and Ranjan have the village leader's permission to visit the jungle as they please (presumably because, with Shere Khan gone, the jungle is now \"certified as safe\").

However, it is important to note that legalizing drugs does not necessarily mean that there will be no demand for other illegal goods and services.\nThere are several factors that could influence the impact of legalizing drugs on the black market:\n1. Reduction in demand: Legalizing drugs could lead to a reduction in demand for illegal drugs, as people would no longer have to resort to illegal means to obtain them. This could result in a decrease in the size and profitability of the black market for illegal drugs.\n2. Shift to other illegal goods and services: Some people may turn to other illegal goods and services, such as illegal gambling, prostitution, or counterfeit goods, if they are unable to obtain drugs legally.\n3. Increase in tax revenue: Legalizing drugs could generate significant tax revenue for governments, which could be used to fund public health programs, education, and other social services. This could potentially reduce the appeal of the black market for drugs, as people may be more willing to pay taxes on legal drugs than support criminal organizations.\n4. Reduction in organized crime: Legalizing drugs could lead to a reduction in organized crime, as criminal organizations that currently profit from the illegal drug trade would lose their primary source of income. This could result in a decrease in the overall size and power of organized crime groups.\n5. Increase in public health and safety: Legalizing drugs could lead to an increase in public health and safety, as people would be able to access drugs in a regulated and controlled environment. This could reduce the risk of overdose, addiction, and other health problems associated with illegal drugs.\n6. Reduction in drug-related violence: Legalizing drugs could lead to a reduction in drug-related violence, as there would be less need for violent conflict over the illegal drug trade. This could result in a decrease in the number of deaths and injuries related to drug-related violence.\n7. Increase in research and development: Legalizing drugs could lead to an increase in research and development of new drugs, as companies would be able to conduct research and development without fear of criminal penalties.

It can help to explain why something is important, how it relates to other things, or what implications it may have. Context can be provided through various means, such as background information, examples, analogies, or explanations.\nOn the other hand, \"whataboutism\" is a specific rhetorical strategy that involves responding to an argument or claim by pointing out a similar or related issue or problem, often in a way that distracts from the original point or creates a false equivalence. The goal of whataboutism is to undermine the validity of the original argument by creating a sense of balance or symmetry, even if the issues being compared are not directly relevant or comparable.\nHere are some key differences between context and whataboutism:\n1. Purpose: Context is provided to help understand and interpret information, while whataboutism is used to avoid addressing the original argument or to create a distraction.\n2. Focus: Context focuses on providing additional information to enhance understanding, while whataboutism focuses on creating a false equivalence or distraction.\n3. Relevance: Context is relevant to the original argument or claim, while whataboutism is often unrelated or tangential.\n4. Intent: Context is provided to help clarify or support an argument, while whataboutism is often used to obfuscate or avoid the original issue.\n5. Tone: Context is typically provided in a neutral or informative tone, while whataboutism can be used to create a defensive or dismissive tone.\nIn summary, context provides additional information to help understand and interpret information, while whataboutism is a rhetorical strategy used to avoid addressing the original argument or to create a distraction.

Cost: Repaving a bridge can be a complex and expensive process, especially if the bridge is large or has a lot of structural damage. The cost of repaving a bridge can be prohibitively expensive, and it may not be feasible to justify the expense.\n2. Structural integrity: If a bridge is structurally sound, it may not need to be repaved. In fact, repaving a bridge can actually weaken its structural integrity if the new pavement is not properly bonded to the existing structure. In such cases, it may be better to leave the existing pavement in place and focus on other maintenance tasks, such as cleaning and sealing the bridge deck.\n3. Maintenance schedule: Many bridges have a regular maintenance schedule that includes inspections and repairs. If a bridge is due for maintenance but does not need to be repaved, the crew may focus on other tasks instead of repaving the entire bridge.\n4. Prioritization: Road construction crews may prioritize their work based on the condition of the bridges they are responsible for maintaining. If a bridge is in poor condition or has a high risk of failure, it may be repaved before other bridges that are in better shape.\n5. Lack of resources: Road construction crews may not have the resources (e.g., funding, personnel, equipment) necessary to repave all of the bridges they are responsible for maintaining. In such cases, they may focus on repaving bridges that are most critical or have the highest priority.\n6. Alternative solutions: In some cases, alternative solutions such as overlaying or patching may be more cost-effective and efficient than repaving an entire bridge. These solutions can extend the life of the bridge and provide a temporary fix until a full repaving is possible.\n7. Bridge design: Some bridges are designed with a specific lifespan in mind, and repaving may not be necessary until the bridge reaches the end of its design life. In such cases, the bridge may be replaced or upgraded rather than repaved.\n8. Environmental concerns: Repaving a bridge can have environmental impacts, such as disturbing wildlife habitats or disrupting water flow. In some cases, it may be more environmentally friendly to leave the existing pavement in", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.3352735739231665, "rouge2": 0.04434072345390898, "rougeL": 0.13736903376018625, "rougeLsum": 0.30966239813736907}, "known": true}

{"id": "5izn8r", "output": [{"answer": "In terms of caloric content, they are the same, but the tasks your body accomplishes with the two are very different.\n\nYour body uses proteins to construct new cells. Think of proteins as the parts of the engine inside your car. The proteins from that burger get deconstructed and reconstituted as proteins inside your cells. That process takes energy. Having an engine isn't enough to make a car run. Enter carbohydrates. If proteins are the parts of your engine, then carbs are your gasoline. They provide the energy (in the form of a molecule called ATP) for your proteins to work.\n\nYour body has a certain metabolic requirement based on your body's content, i.e. How muscular, how tall, how active you are, etc. When you eat food, the proteins are put to work and the sugar/carbs power everything. Your body is extra smart and does something the car can't - after all it evolved in a calorie-poor world - so it takes all the leftover carbs that are \"excess\" to what is required by your body at that time and converts them into fat for storage. That fat can then be accessed for energy if you haven't eaten in a while or if you're using more energy than you have carbs to supply.\n\nNow imagine a situation in which you eat something that is more or less entirely carbs like said donut. With little in the way of protein for your body to use, you'll have a temporary bump in sugar that isn't supplying energy for anything useful, so what happens to it? Fat.\n\nWith the burger, instead, you have nutrients that require metabolism that the carbs can be used for.\n\nSo why, then, do they appear to have equal value as conveyed by their calorie count? Because a calorie is a unit of energy, aka it's capacity to enact a change or apply a force to something. Through various complex mechanisms (of course), your body can interconvert some proteins and sugars and turn them into energy, but this process is much less efficient and much less straightforward than just getting said nutrients from your diet. So, while the caloric content of the burger and donut may be equal, the ramifications for your body are quite different. One permits some degree of healthy function where the other is much less able to.\n\nFun fact: we measure calories using a tool called a calorimeter... a box in which we place the burger, burn it with fire, and measure how much oxygen got used up by the burning burger to tell us how much energy was used in the flames.

Think of proteins as the parts of the engine inside your car. The proteins from that burger get deconstructed and reconstituted as proteins inside your cells. That process takes energy. Having an engine isn't enough to make a car run. Enter carbohydrates. If proteins are the parts of your engine, then carbs are your gasoline. They provide the energy (in the form of a molecule called ATP) for your proteins to work.\n\nYour body has a certain metabolic requirement based on your body's content, i.e. How muscular, how tall, how active you are, etc. When you eat food, the proteins are put to work and the sugar/carbs power everything. Your body is extra smart and does something the car can't - after all it evolved in a calorie-poor world - so it takes all the leftover carbs that are \"excess\" to what is required by your body at that time and converts them into fat for storage. That fat can then be accessed for energy if you haven't eaten in a while or if you're using more energy than you have carbs to supply.\n\nNow imagine a situation in which you eat something that is more or less entirely carbs like said donut. With little in the way of protein for your body to use, you'll have a temporary bump in sugar that isn't supplying energy for anything useful, so what happens to it? Fat.\n\nWith the burger, instead, you have nutrients that require metabolism that the carbs can be used for.\n\nSo why, then, do they appear to have equal value as conveyed by their calorie count? Because a calorie is a unit of energy, aka it's capacity to enact a change or apply a force to something. Through various complex mechanisms (of course), your body can interconvert some proteins and sugars and turn them into energy, but this process is much less efficient and much less straightforward than just getting said nutrients from your diet. So, while the caloric content of the burger and donut may be equal, the ramifications for your body are quite different. One permits some degree of healthy function where the other is much less able to.\n\nFun fact: we measure calories using a tool called a calorimeter... a box in which we place the burger, burn it with fire, and measure how much oxygen got used up by the burning burger to tell us how much energy was used in the flames. Thus, we have measured the burger's calorie content.\n\nSource: am doctor**\n\n\n\n\n**in 5 months", "There's far more qualified people than me who can break this down, but I can give you a somewhat close answer. \n\nBasically 300 calories is 300 calories. Let's assume you burn 2000 calories a day. You could eat 1500 calories worth of McDonald's and lose weight. You'd gain fat and lose muscle and have a bunch of health issues, but that number on the scale would drop. \n\nOr you could eat 1500 worth of vegetables fruits healthy fats and lean meat, you'd build muscle and lose fat, and the number on the scale would still go down. \n\nThere's fine tuning people do, for exactly how much protein or carbs or healthy fats they can eat to maximize their diet. \n\nBasically you eat less than you burn, you lose weight no matter if it's fat or muscle. You eat more than you burn and you gain. *What* you eat determines if your body is going to burn that fat instead of muscle or not.", "Calories are simply a measure of how much heat energy the substance will provide when burnt, hence if you're simply talking about how much energy you get from different types of food, 300 calories from anything is exactly the same as another.\n\nWhen talking about gaining weight from these substances, the composition of the food might matter a bit, however this is usually not significant due to the processes where digested food is turned into body mass.\n\nFood contains mainly carbohydrates, fats and proteins, which will get turned into glucose, triglycerides, fatty acids and amino acids when they're absorbed into the bloodstream.

Macronutrient composition: A standard donut typically contains a higher proportion of carbohydrates (sugars) compared to a burger. Donuts are often made with refined flour, sugar, and fats, while burgers are typically made with protein-rich meat, whole grains, and vegetables.\nDonut:\n* Carbohydrates: 50-60 grams\n* Protein: 2-3 grams\n* Fat: 10-15 grams\nBurger:\n* Carbohydrates: 30-40 grams\n* Protein: 10-15 grams\n* Fat: 20-30 grams\n2. Fiber content: Donuts are typically low in fiber, while burgers can contain some fiber from the whole grains and vegetables.\nDonut:\n* Fiber: 1-2 grams\nBurger:\n* Fiber: 3-5 grams\n3. Sugar content: Donuts are often high in added sugars, while burgers may contain some natural sugars from the meat and vegetables.\nDonut:\n* Sugar: 15-20 grams\nBurger:\n* Sugar: 5-10 grams\n4. Sodium content: Donuts are often high in sodium due to the added preservatives and seasonings, while burgers can be high in sodium from the meat and condiments.\nDonut:\n* Sodium: 200-300 milligrams\nBurger:\n* Sodium: 400-600 milligrams\n5. Nutrient density: Donuts are generally considered to be low in nutrient density, meaning they provide a small amount of nutrients per calorie compared to other foods. Burgers, on the other hand, can be higher in nutrient density due to the protein and whole grains.\nIn summary, while both donuts and burgers can be part of a healthy diet in moderation, donuts", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.260748959778086, "rouge2": 0.013908205841446452, "rougeL": 0.11373092926490984, "rougeLsum": 0.22191400832177532}, "known": false}

These acts of devotion and respect are widely accepted and encouraged in the Muslim community.\nUltimately, the decision to name one's child after the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is a personal choice that depends on individual beliefs and cultural practices.

He spent the next several years working tirelessly to demonstrate the advantages of AC over direct current (DC) systems, which were then the dominant technology.\nTesla's efforts eventually paid off, and he was able to secure funding for his research and development projects from wealthy investors such as George Westinghouse and J.P.

The reason you can easily recall numbers that come before and after a given number (like 7) is because we have a natural tendency to group numbers into sequences or patterns. Here are some possible reasons why you might find it easier to recall numbers than letters:\n1. Number sequences: Numbers tend to follow predictable patterns, such as counting up by increments of 1, 5, or 10. This makes it easier to remember numbers that come before and after a given number. For example, you can easily recall that there are 6 numbers that come before 7 (6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) and 6 numbers that come after 7 (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13).\n2. Visualization: Numbers are often represented visually, which can make them easier to remember. For example, you can visualize the numbers on a number line or in a chart, which can help you recall their positions.\n3. Practice: You may have had more practice recalling numbers than letters, especially in everyday situations like counting objects or solving math problems. This repetition can make it easier to recall numbers more quickly and accurately.\nOn the other hand, letters are not as naturally grouped or sequenced, which can make them harder to recall. Here are some possible reasons why you might find it harder to recall letters than numbers:\n1. Letter patterns: Letters do not follow as predictable patterns as numbers, so it's harder to memorize and recall their positions. While there are some patterns in the English alphabet (e.g., the letters b, c, d, and p are all consonants), these patterns are not as consistent or easy to recognize as number patterns.\n2. Lack of visualization: Unlike numbers, letters are not typically represented visually, which can make them harder to remember. You can't easily visualize the letters on a page or in a chart, which can make it harder to recall their positions.\n3. Less practice: You may not have had as much practice recalling letters as numbers, especially in everyday situations. This lack of repetition can make it harder to recall letters more quickly and accurately.\nOverall, both numbers and letters have their own unique characteristics that can affect how easily they can be re", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.16363636363636364, "rouge2": 0.0045662100456621, "rougeL": 0.1090909090909091, "rougeLsum": 0.11818181818181817}, "known": false}

While it is true that anxiety is associated with the release of adrenaline (epinephrine) and other stress hormones, simply blocking the production of these hormones is not a straightforward solution for treating anxiety disorders. Here are some reasons why:\n1. Evolutionary role: Adrenaline plays an important role in the body's \"fight or flight\" response, which helps individuals respond to perceived threats or dangers. Blocking the production of adrenaline could compromise this essential function, leading to impaired ability to respond to real threats.\n2. Complexity of anxiety: Anxiety is a multifaceted disorder that involves various psychological, neurological, and physiological mechanisms. Simply reducing the production of adrenaline may not be enough to fully address the underlying causes of anxiety.\n3. Individual differences: People have different levels of sensitivity to adrenaline and different responses to stressors, which can affect how they experience anxiety. A drug that blocks adrenaline production may have varying degrees of effectiveness across individuals.\n4. Side effects: Drugs that block adrenaline production, such as beta-blockers, can have significant side effects, including fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and decreased heart rate. These side effects can impact an individual's quality of life and may not be tolerable for long-term use.\n5. Development of tolerance: Over time, the body can develop tolerance to adrenaline-blocking drugs, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect. This can lead to increased risk of side effects and decreased efficacy.\n6. Alternative mechanisms: Anxiety can also involve other neurotransmitters and neural pathways, such as serotonin, dopamine, and GABA. Targeting these alternative mechanisms may be more effective in treating anxiety disorders.\n7. Personalized medicine: Each individual's anxiety disorder may have unique underlying mechanisms, which can require personalized treatment approaches. A one-size-fits-all approach to blocking adrenaline production may not be effective for everyone.\n8.

Your body, if I'm not mistaken, produces melatonin and other chemicals which make you feel a little more tired when you see darkness or the sunset/rise"], "llama7b_without_search_answer": " There are several reasons why it can be harder to get up in the morning, and some of them are related to the time of day. Here are some possible explanations:\n1. Circadian rhythm: Our bodies have an internal clock, or circadian rhythm, that regulates our sleep-wake cycle. This rhythm is controlled by a small group of cells in the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN responds to light and dark signals from the environment to synchronize our bodily functions with the 24-hour day-night cycle. When it's time to wake up in the morning, the SCN sends signals to the rest of the body to help us feel alert and awake. If we're not exposed to enough light in the morning, our circadian rhythm can become disrupted, making it harder to wake up.\n2. Melatonin levels: Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate our sleep-wake cycle. It's produced by the pineal gland in the brain and peaks in the evening, helping us feel sleepy. Melatonin levels typically decrease in the morning, which can make it harder to wake up. If you're not exposed to enough morning light, your melatonin levels may not drop as quickly, making it harder to wake up.\n3. Sleep inertia: Sleep inertia is the feeling of grogginess and disorientation that can occur after waking up. It's caused by the sudden transition from a state of deep sleep to a state of full alertness. This can be especially true if you wake up during a period of deep sleep, which is typically around 90 minutes after falling asleep. Waking up too early in the morning can lead to sleep inertia, making it harder to feel alert and awake.\n4. Genetics: Some people may be naturally more inclined to feel groggy and disoriented in the morning due to their genetic makeup. Research has shown that certain genetic variations can affect the body's ability to regulate its circadian rhythm, leading to difficulty waking up in the morning.\n5. Lack of sleep quality: If you're not getting enough sleep or your sleep is poor quality, you may feel more tired and groggy in the", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.31261770244821097, "rouge2": 0.03780718336483932, "rougeL": 0.13935969868173256, "rougeLsum": 0.17702448210922786}, "known": true}

Evaporated milk is a sweetened, condensed milk that has been evaporated to remove some of the water content, resulting in a creamy and rich texture.\n2. Condensed milk: Condensed milk is another type of sweetened milk that is commonly used in tres leches cake. It is made by evaporating whole milk to remove some of the water content, and then adding sugar to sweeten it. Condensed milk has a thicker and creamier texture than evaporated milk.\n3. Heavy cream: Some recipes for tres leches cake call for the use of heavy cream instead of or in addition to evaporated milk and condensed milk. Heavy cream is a thick and rich dairy product that adds a luxurious and creamy texture to the cake.\nThe combination of these three milks creates a moist and flavorful cake that is popular in many Latin American countries. The cake is typically soaked in the three milks, which helps to add moisture and flavor to the cake.

It can cause symptoms such as difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, and a drop in blood pressure. Epinephrine is a medication that helps to quickly reverse these symptoms by constricting blood vessels, improving breathing, and increasing heart rate.\nThe EpiPen is a small, portable device that contains a single dose of epinephrine. It is designed to be easy to use, with a simple mechanism that allows the user to inject the medication into their body through the skin. The EpiPen is typically administered into the outer thigh, and the needle is automatically inserted and removed, making it easy to use in an emergency situation.\nHere's how an EpiPen works:\n1. The user removes the EpiPen from its carrying case and holds it in their hand.\n2. The user flips the safety cap on the pen and pushes the black base of the pen against the outer thigh of their leg.\n3. The user pulls the safety cap back and the needle is automatically inserted into the leg.\n4. The user pushes the pen against the leg to inject the epinephrine.\n5. The EpiPen delivers a single dose of epinephrine through the needle, which is absorbed into the body through the skin.\n6. The user should wait for at least 10 seconds after the injection to ensure that the full dose of epinephrine is delivered.\n7. The user should then call 911 or their local emergency number for further medical attention.\nIt's important to note that the EpiPen is a single-use device and once the dose is administered, it should be disposed of properly.\nIt's also important to always carry the EpiPen with you at all times if you have a history of severe allergies, and to inform your friends, family, and caregivers about", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.2470308788598575, "rouge2": 0.06205250596658712, "rougeL": 0.14251781472684086, "rougeLsum": 0.22802850356294535}, "known": true}

In the United States, for example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers prize winnings as taxable income, and the winner is required to report and pay taxes on the full amount of the prize.\nThere are several reasons why prize money is taxed:\n1. To fund government programs: Tax revenue from prize winnings helps to fund various government programs and services, such as infrastructure, education, healthcare, and national defense.\n2. To level the playing field: Taxing prize winnings helps to reduce economic inequality by redistributing wealth from those who win large prizes to those who may be struggling financially.\n3. To encourage responsible financial planning: By taxing prize winnings, the government encourages winners to be responsible with their newfound wealth and to plan for their financial future.\n4. To prevent illegal activities: Large cash prizes can attract criminal activity, such as fraud or money laundering, and taxing them helps to prevent these illegal activities.\n5. To fund social programs: In some countries, a portion of the tax revenue from prize winnings is used to fund social programs, such as healthcare, education, and social welfare.\nThe amount of taxes owed on prize money varies depending on the amount won and the tax laws in the winner's jurisdiction. In general, the tax rate on prize winnings is higher than the average tax rate for other forms of income, such as wages or investment income, because the prize money is considered \"windfall\" income.\nIn the United States, for example, the federal government taxes prize winnings at a rate of 25% for most prizes, and some states also have their own taxes on prize winnings. Additionally, the winner may also owe state and local taxes, depending on where they live.\nIt's worth noting that there are some exceptions to the taxation of prize winnings, such as prizes that are considered \"small\" or \"nominal,\" which may not be subject to taxation. However, these exceptions vary by jurisdiction, and it's always best to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor for specific", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.1686182669789227, "rouge2": 0.018823529411764708, "rougeL": 0.08899297423887588, "rougeLsum": 0.1405152224824356}, "known": false}

The Italian army was well-equipped and well-trained, but they were no match for the Ethiopian army, which was larger and more experienced. Despite being outnumbered, the Ethiopians were able to use their knowledge of the terrain and their traditional fighting tactics to launch a series of successful counterattacks against the Italians.\nThe turning point of the war came in May 1896, when the Ethiopian emperor, Menelik II, led his army to a decisive victory at the Battle of Adwa, which is located in the northwestern part of the country. The battle was a crushing defeat for the Italians, and they were forced to retreat back to their own territory.\nThe aftermath of the war saw the signing of the Treaty of Addis Ababa, which recognized Ethiopia's independence and sovereignty over its territory.

According to some accounts, Alexander spared Porus' life and made him a vassal king, allowing him to rule over his own kingdom.\nThe exact details of the war are not well documented, as the ancient sources are limited, but it is generally agreed that Alexander's superior military tactics and weaponry gave him the upper hand in the conflict.\nIn summary, Alexander the Great defeated Porus and his army in the War of Porus and Alexander, and Porus was forced to surrender and become a vassal king.", "known": true}

However, the modern understanding and articulation of the principle of separation of powers as we know it today can be traced back to the 17th and 18th centuries in Europe, particularly in the works of political philosophers such as John Locke, Montesquieu, and James Madison.\nJohn Locke (1632-1704) is often considered one of the earliest and most influential proponents of the separation of powers. In his seminal work \"Two Treatises of Government\" (1689), Locke argued that the purpose of government is to protect the natural rights of individuals, and that the best way to do this is to divide power among different branches of government. According to Locke, the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government should be separate and independent of each other to prevent any one branch from becoming too powerful.\nAnother important figure in the development of the separation of powers principle is Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu (1689-1755). In his book \"The Spirit of the Laws\" (1748), Montesquieu argued that the separation of powers was essential to prevent the abuse of power and to ensure that government remained accountable to the people. He believed that the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government should be separate and independent, and that each branch should have distinct powers and responsibilities.\nJames Madison (1751-1836), one of the founding fathers of the United States, was also a strong advocate for the separation of powers. In his Federalist No. 51 (1788), Madison wrote that \"the powers ought to be divided, and the constant exercise of them by different bodies, will render the expression of power more difficult and fluctuating.\" Madison believed that the separation of powers would help to prevent the concentration of power in any one person or group, and would ensure that government remained accountable to the people.\nOverall, while the concept of separation of powers has a long history, the modern understanding and articulation of the principle can be traced back to the works of John Locke, Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu", "ppl": 4.953948020935059, "known": true}

Examples of voltage-gated ion channels include voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), and voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs).\n2. Ligand-gated ion channels: These ion channels are activated by specific ligands, such as neurotransmitters, that bind to the extracellular domain of the channel protein. Examples of ligand-gated ion channels include nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and GABA receptors.\n3. Mechanosensitive ion channels: These ion channels are activated by changes in the mechanical properties of the cell membrane, such as stretching or compression. Examples of mechanosensitive ion channels include Piezo channels and TRP channels.\n4. Two-pore potassium channels: These ion channels are activated by changes in the electrical potential across the cell membrane and allow potassium ions to flow out of the cell. Examples of two-pore potassium channels include K2P channels and SK channels.\n5. Calcium-activated potassium channels: These ion channels are activated by an increase in intracellular calcium ions and allow potassium ions to flow out of the cell. Examples of calcium-activated potassium channels include BK channels and IK channels.\n6. Chloride channels: These ion channels are important for the regulation of the resting membrane potential and the excitability of the neuron. Examples of chloride channels include ClC channels and CFTR channels.\n7. Gating modulators: These ion channels are activated by specific molecules, such as neurotransmitters,", "known": true}

Here are some reasons why immigration is a significant political issue in the UK currently:\n1. Changing demographics: The UK's population is becoming increasingly diverse, with immigration contributing to the country's growth. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK's population is projected to reach 70 million by 2029, with around 14% of the population being non-UK born. This shift in demographics has led to concerns about the impact on public services, housing, and jobs.\n2. Economic competition: Some argue that high levels of immigration can lead to economic competition, particularly in low-skilled jobs. This has led to calls for stricter border controls and immigration policies to protect British workers. However, research suggests that immigration can also bring economic benefits, such as filling labor shortages and contributing to economic growth.\n3. Political polarization: The issue of immigration has become increasingly politicized, with some parties advocating for stricter controls and others pushing for a more welcoming approach. This polarization has led to heated debates and controversial policies, such as the introduction of a points-based system for immigration.\n4. Public opinion: According to a survey by the UK's Home Office, 56% of respondents believe that immigration has had a negative impact on the UK's economy. This perception has contributed to the political debate and has led to calls for action from politicians.\nNow, let's discuss the effects of immigration on the UK economy:\n1. Labor market: Immigration can help address labor shortages in certain sectors, particularly in industries such as healthcare, social care, and construction. According to the Migration Advisory Committee, there are estimated to be around 100,000 unfilled vacancies in these sectors.\n2. Economic growth: Research suggests that immigration can contribute to economic growth, particularly in the short term. A study by the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics found that immigration can increase GDP by up to 0.5% in the long term.\n3.

If we carried our full weight on a completely flat foot, we wouldn't have the same forward-momentum and bipedal pattern that we currently have today. \n\nAlso, modern humans have something called the bicondylar angle with our legs and hips. As we evolved as obligate bipeds, our pelvises changed to become wider (supporting upright weight) and our bottom halves evolved as well. The bicondylar angle basically means that our legs come in from the hips at a V-angle, so that our feet are directly under us when we walk. (PS, this angle is evolutionary but also acquired -- so someone today who has lost function of their legs early on would not have the angle!). This is now my own speculation as we didn't cover this but I think that having flat feet along with the angle would lead to a loss of balance and we wouldn't be able to walk the way we do or as well as we do.\n\nFINALLY -- Laetoli Footprints found in Tanzania show that A. afarensis (perceived human ancestor) was walking upright but patterns show that weight is not distributed on the foot the same way we do.

It's much easier to rebalance yourself by applying force through the ball of the foot and toes when you are overbalanced and through the heel when you are underbalanced. They serve as points that you can concentrate force through.\n\n A flat foot would disperse the force and make it much harder to apply simple rebalancing corrections because you'd be pressing down on the floor with the middle of the foot. For arched feet, the medial and longitudinal arches create a section of the foot that won't touch the ground. Any force you apply if you are falling forward or back is going to end up driving through the ball or the heel (on two feet. On one foot, your body will start inversion and eversion of the ankles to maintain balance).\n\nIt's much the same reason why expert handbalancers (such as those you might watch in cirque du soliel) do not balance on their hands with completely flat palms. Their fingers are usually arched at the second knuckles, providing for more force through the finger when overbalanced than with a flat palm.", "meta": {"score": 612}}, {"answer": "Orthopaedic surgeon here. Foot anatomy is actually pretty complex, and I'll try and provide a limited explanation to keep this as ELI5 as possible. \n\nThe foot actually has three arches. The medial arch is the one that is usually recognized by most people as \"the arch.\" There is also a lateral and a transverse arch. Because the medial arch is the one people tend to think of, that's mostly what I'll focus on. All of these arches have \"keystones\" or important bones at the center of each arch. The medial arch has a bone called the talus as its keystone. The reason this arch concept is important is because a true arch/keystone construct is one of the strongest structures you can create. That's why bridges and structures containing Roman arches (the same concept as the foot arch) still stand thousands of years later. This creates an incredibly strong and stable platform for your body to stand on, and can support an amazing amount of force when running, jumping, etc.\n\nThe arch also acts as part of a \"windlass mechanism.\" Basically, your heel bone (calcaneus) is attached to your plantar fascia (the hard band you feel in your arch), which in turn attaches to bones under your big toe (sesamoids) which have tendinous attachments to the tip of your big toe. This connection serves many purposes, but one of the big ones is when you walk. As you push off and your heel leaves the ground, this windlass mechanism generated by your great toe bending up (dorsiflexing) pulls on the plantar fascia. This actually raises your arch (makes it taller). When this happens (along with a few other mechanisms in your foot), it causes a portion of your foot to lock into place. This provides a stable platform to push your body off with. And as you swing your leg through, the windlass relaxes thus providing a soft foot to land on. (There are other things that happen to other portions of your foot during all of this, so please don't message me about how I forgot about the transverse tarsal joint, blah blah). \n\nThe other reason has been mentioned here before, and that it can act as a sort of shock absorber. It can deform (very slightly) with loading. This goes back up to the Roman arch concept. As you load the top of the arch, it pushes down on the keystone. The keystone pushes on the other stones and they lock into one another. There may be some slight deformation of the arch during this time, but not much.\n\nThe problem with flat feet (people with true flat feet) is that because they have no arch there foot collapses into a pretty predictable pattern. This loss of the arch (not just the medial arch, but all three arches) prevents normal motions in your foot required for walking. People with true flat feet typically can't do a single heel raise, and have problems pushing off their foot when they walk. Other people with flat feet have a problem on uneven ground and can get arthritis in surrounding joints (usually linked to a genetic issue called a tarsal coalition). So while the surface area is increased for total contact, several of the mechanisms required for normal foot function are lost. \n\nThere are lots of other reasons as well, but that's probably enough to help answer the question you asked. This will probably get buried cause its so late, but thought you'd like an explanation from someone who is in the field. \n\nEdit: TL;DR: Its complex.

It helps spread the impact over a larger area of their body and prevents breaking something by concentrating it over a small area like their feet. \n\nWhen you step down onto your foot, the arch shape causes a kind of rolling gate as you step, which helps act like a shock absorber. Without the arches, if you landed heavily on your feet, or even if you just ran normally, the shock of each foot fall would be more clearly transmitted to the ankle and knee and it would begin to cause damage. \n\nThe inward rolling of the arch helps to prevent that. It's not that the arch flexes like a spring, so much as it rolls inwards like a person rolling to absorb an impact. It both spreads the force over a larger area of the foot, and also slows down the impact just like the shocks in a car. \n\nIf you could see how a foot makes contact with the ground, like by watching a person walk on glass and stared underneath, you would see the outside edge of the foot makes contact first, then it rolls towards the inside of the foot as weight comes down. \n\nPeople who have fallen arches have less of this rolling or none at all, and their feet tend to become over pronated (tilted inward at the ankle causing a twisting of the ankle and rotation of the foot) which in turn leads to knee pain and a less steady walk. \n\nYou might find this image helpful.

I imagine this is because muscle force won't be quite the same as weight distribution.\n\nYour intuition is pointing at the idea that increased area leads to decreased forces via decreased pressure. This may do something to help with damage to skin on the bottom of the foot, but it's not directly relevant to how the foot muscles apply forces to keep you upright. Remember that muscles 1) can only pull, and 2) can only pull their 2 ends closer together. That means that muscles 1) cannot push, and 2) need to be attached to something at either end to make anything move.\n\nThat basically means that any joint in your body only works when it's a hinge.

If we carried our full weight on a completely flat foot, we wouldn't have the same forward-momentum and bipedal pattern that we currently have today. \n\nAlso, modern humans have something called the bicondylar angle with our legs and hips. As we evolved as obligate bipeds, our pelvises changed to become wider (supporting upright weight) and our bottom halves evolved as well. The bicondylar angle basically means that our legs come in from the hips at a V-angle, so that our feet are directly under us when we walk. (PS, this angle is evolutionary but also acquired -- so someone today who has lost function of their legs early on would not have the angle!). This is now my own speculation as we didn't cover this but I think that having flat feet along with the angle would lead to a loss of balance and we wouldn't be able to walk the way we do or as well as we do.\n\nFINALLY -- Laetoli Footprints found in Tanzania show that A. afarensis (perceived human ancestor) was walking upright but patterns show that weight is not distributed on the foot the same way we do. Their bicondylar angle also isn't as pronounced as in modern humans so I think that it's all related!!!", "One reason why foot with three arches works better than a foot no arches is for balancing. It's much easier to rebalance yourself by applying force through the ball of the foot and toes when you are overbalanced and through the heel when you are underbalanced. They serve as points that you can concentrate force through.\n\n A flat foot would disperse the force and make it much harder to apply simple rebalancing corrections because you'd be pressing down on the floor with the middle of the foot. For arched feet, the medial and longitudinal arches create a section of the foot that won't touch the ground. Any force you apply if you are falling forward or back is going to end up driving through the ball or the heel (on two feet. On one foot, your body will start inversion and eversion of the ankles to maintain balance).\n\nIt's much the same reason why expert handbalancers (such as those you might watch in cirque du soliel) do not balance on their hands with completely flat palms. Their fingers are usually arched at the second knuckles, providing for more force through the finger when overbalanced than with a flat palm.", "Orthopaedic surgeon here. Foot anatomy is actually pretty complex, and I'll try and provide a limited explanation to keep this as ELI5 as possible. \n\nThe foot actually has three arches. The medial arch is the one that is usually recognized by most people as \"the arch.\" There is also a lateral and a transverse arch. Because the medial arch is the one people tend to think of, that's mostly what I'll focus on. All of these arches have \"keystones\" or important bones at the center of each arch. The medial arch has a bone called the talus as its keystone. The reason this arch concept is important is because a true arch/keystone construct is one of the strongest structures you can create. That's why bridges and structures containing Roman arches (the same concept as the foot arch) still stand thousands of years later. This creates an incredibly strong and stable platform for your body to stand on, and can support an amazing amount of force when running, jumping, etc.\n\nThe arch also acts as part of a \"windlass mechanism.\" Basically, your heel bone (calcaneus) is attached to your plantar fascia (the hard band you feel in your arch), which in turn attaches to bones under your big toe (sesamoids) which have tendinous attachments to the tip of your big toe. This connection serves many purposes, but one of the big ones is when you walk. As you push off and your heel leaves the ground, this windlass mechanism generated by your great toe bending up (dorsiflexing) pulls on the plantar fascia. This actually raises your arch (makes it taller). When this happens (along with a few other mechanisms in your foot), it causes a portion of your foot to lock into place. This provides a stable platform to push your body off with. And as you swing your leg through, the windlass relaxes thus providing a soft foot to land on. (There are other things that happen to other portions of your foot during all of this, so please don't message me about how I forgot about the transverse tarsal joint, blah blah). \n\nThe other reason has been mentioned here before, and that it can act as a sort of shock absorber. It can deform (very slightly) with loading. This goes back up to the Roman arch concept. As you load the top of the arch, it pushes down on the keystone. The keystone pushes on the other stones and they lock into one another. There may be some slight deformation of the arch during this time, but not much.\n\nThe problem with flat feet (people with true flat feet) is that because they have no arch there foot collapses into a pretty predictable pattern. This loss of the arch (not just the medial arch, but all three arches) prevents normal motions in your foot required for walking. People with true flat feet typically can't do a single heel raise, and have problems pushing off their foot when they walk. Other people with flat feet have a problem on uneven ground and can get arthritis in surrounding joints (usually linked to a genetic issue called a tarsal coalition). So while the surface area is increased for total contact, several of the mechanisms required for normal foot function are lost. \n\nThere are lots of other reasons as well, but that's probably enough to help answer the question you asked. This will probably get buried cause its so late, but thought you'd like an explanation from someone who is in the field. \n\nEdit: TL;DR: Its complex. Arches are strong and something about a windlass mechanism. Shock absorption, sort of.", "Let's say you wanted to build a bridge where the strain on the bridge would be on all points equally. How would you build it, as an arch or a straight line? That's your feet. The ground is rarely a straight line, it's usually a bridge from one point to the other (even if the points are extremely close to each other), and the best way to distribute the strain is an arch.", "We humans are top-heavy and we like to move a lot. And gravity is trying to pull us to the ground all the time. And the world is a bumpy place. And we do a lot of walking — (average is 3,000 steps a day). So imagine the kind of beating your feet take every day! The force of 3,000 steps can add up to hundreds of tons – that’s like a fully loaded cement truck. How do your feet handle it?\n\n1. They have a built-in cooling system. All that running around gets them pretty hot! But your feet have 250,000 sweat glands, which is way more than any other part of your body! That makes a cup of perspiration a day.\n\n2. Each foot is a complex machine that self-adjusts in response to uneven terrain. Theyare able to do this because together they have one-quarter of all your bones, sinews and muscles: each foot has 26 bones, 33 joints, more than 100 muscles, tendons  &  ligaments and 7,800 nerves. All of those tiny parts allow your feet to change shape depending on the surface, like grass, sand or rocks.\n\n3. *Now to the arch*. That \"arch\" is actually made of **three** (some say five) interconnected arches. They work together in the most optimal design to give your body the maximum possible shock absorption while you walk and run. This explains why the flat-footed all say what they say here. Without arches, feet take a tremendous beating.\n\nBTW, what about the toes? Do you really need these funny knobs sticking out of your feet to walk? Just ask someone who’s missing one or more toes — sure they can walk, but toes make it about a thousand times easier to balance, especially when running.\n\n(Now, with such amazing, self-adjusting, shock-absorbing balancing machines to stand on, do we really need shoes? People who go barefoot develop tough soles and strong foot muscles. Bad shoes can ruin the springiness of your arches. And for those who do have good arches, some expensive running shoes actually lead to more foot, ankle and knee injuries than going barefoot.)", "Well it does seem logical to think that, but by having flat feet we lose dexterity and the ability for quick movement. This is the reason why boxers/fighters move on their toes, you can shift your weight faster and easier allowing for greater speed in movement.\n\nFrom a general perspective I think most animals walk on their tip toes, or have limbs designed to put their weight on a very small point for the same purpose.\n\nMaybe if evolution had favored other traits like the ability to carry more weight or something like that we might have been flat footed.", "From the little I know about foot arches, it's because of the natural spring mechanism we have for running.

Kind of like a bridge is suspended and its strong?", "I think that the arch is the result of our elvolving from   mammalian ancestors whose foot was more extended, like most mammals today. If you look at a dog or cat, you will notice that what is analogous to our heal, on them is way off the ground. They use the extended end of the foot or paw as the only point of contact with the ground. This is more conducive to speed as the tendon acts more like a rubber band and springs them forward.  Primates tend to have more of this surface in contact with the ground but still hsve the tendon which extends the foot in walking and running. The arch comes from the natural shape resulting from the evolution of our foot to a more flexed foot while maintaining some mechanical advantage for the tendon that extends the foot. If the arch collapses much of  the mechanical advantage of the extensor tendon is lost. Also the bone that make up the arch collapse and are wear abnormally.", "Not a foot expert by any means but I imagine the arch provides a cushion for the joints, allowing a bit of give when we walk/run.

A stool with one leg is okay but needs a large base and a flat surface to balance. A two legged stool would need the same thing. However a tripod can balance effortlessly on any level surface. \n\nMost stools these days have 4 legs as they're used in flat bars and restarting so. But I'm sure you'll know the frustration of having a four legged chair on an uneven floor as only 3 legs touch the ground at once and it wobbles. \n\nFor outdoor use we've designed tripods for cameras because they can be mounted on uneven surfaces and camping stools have 3 legs too. Our feet do the same thing.\n\nIf you look at the bottom of your feet you can see the balls or the \"corners\" which stick out more. They act like the three legs of a tripod when stood still with your toes there to curve to the surface you're stood on and help you balance. \n\nWhen you go to walk forwards or stand on your toes, your weight shifts forward and your heel lifts off the ground. Now, instead of using your heel as the third leg, you use your big toe. It's the third point of contact between the floor and you to keep you stable.\n\nWithout that toe it'll fall to another toe to do the job but as they're not as big or spread apart it becomes more and more like the point of a tripod. We have two feet which do this and it's that advantage that allows us to walk on two legs as this means we could use 2 points on one foot and one on the other. \n\nWhen walking this could be the two balls of the front of one foot and the heel of the other. \n\nTry it out! See where the weight is resting on your feet and then move around to see how it changes. Also try standing on just your heels or just one heel and see how much harder it is.

This, and the middle of your foot being weaker due to bone structure, is why people with flat feet experience pain.\n\nTL;DR - The best way to balance anything on an uneven surface is with 3 legs (think camera tripod). Our feet are designed to always have 3 points of contact with the ground and shift when we walk.", "Have you ever wondered why people who know their way around jumping, will roll when landing from a great height? It helps spread the impact over a larger area of their body and prevents breaking something by concentrating it over a small area like their feet. \n\nWhen you step down onto your foot, the arch shape causes a kind of rolling gate as you step, which helps act like a shock absorber. Without the arches, if you landed heavily on your feet, or even if you just ran normally, the shock of each foot fall would be more clearly transmitted to the ankle and knee and it would begin to cause damage. \n\nThe inward rolling of the arch helps to prevent that. It's not that the arch flexes like a spring, so much as it rolls inwards like a person rolling to absorb an impact. It both spreads the force over a larger area of the foot, and also slows down the impact just like the shocks in a car. \n\nIf you could see how a foot makes contact with the ground, like by watching a person walk on glass and stared underneath, you would see the outside edge of the foot makes contact first, then it rolls towards the inside of the foot as weight comes down. \n\nPeople who have fallen arches have less of this rolling or none at all, and their feet tend to become over pronated (tilted inward at the ankle causing a twisting of the ankle and rotation of the foot) which in turn leads to knee pain and a less steady walk. \n\nYou might find this image helpful. [This is a persons right foot.](_URL_1_) The arch on the right foot, is inward, on the left bottom of that foot. In a fallen arch situation, it causes the over pronation and the entire foot and ankle rotate.", "A lot of these comments are disappointing, even for ELI5.\n\nAccording to [this older askscience post](_URL_5_) and [wikipedia](_URL_4_), arches minimize the forces that your foot needs to exert to maintain an upright posture - it's a development related to being bipedal, not related to running or anything. I imagine this is because muscle force won't be quite the same as weight distribution.\n\nYour intuition is pointing at the idea that increased area leads to decreased forces via decreased pressure. This may do something to help with damage to skin on the bottom of the foot, but it's not directly relevant to how the foot muscles apply forces to keep you upright. Remember that muscles 1) can only pull, and 2) can only pull their 2 ends closer together. That means that muscles 1) cannot push, and 2) need to be attached to something at either end to make anything move.\n\nThat basically means that any joint in your body only works when it's a hinge. Instead of having one big hinge that can't adapt to many different situations, the foot is made of many little hinges that can adapt to and absorb all sorts of impacts and forces.\n\nIf you think about how it would work to have a flat foot, you have two options - one hinge or multiple hinges. One hinge (i.e. just an ankle) could be very awkward to use on uneven ground, and would probably gravitate towards the solution that Boston Dynamics uses for its [quadruped robots](_URL_4_) (basically a hoof). Many hinges in a flat foot might work, but then the muscle and bone arrangements get a bit awkward to produce any meaningful forces, as illustrated in the [kneecap demo gif](_URL_5_) that occasionally makes the rounds on here.", "Podiatrist / biomechanics professor here.\n\nWithout an \"arch,\" sure the weight would be distributed nice and evenly throughout, this would be great for when your foot hits the ground. But once our foot hits the ground, we need to \"push\" and propel ourselves forward again. The \"arch\" (and other biomechanical changes in our foot) gives us a solid and \"stiff\" foot to give it a nice stable piece to push off of. Remember, the most stable construct is a tripod, and an arch affords us to have that in our foot (inside ball of your foot, outside ball of your foot, heel) instead of a flat floppy piece.\n\nWhen we walk, it is a constant dance between pronating and supinating. As our foot hits the ground and we put weight on it, the foot pronates (arch flattens, foot is nice and floppy in order to adapt to uneven terrain). As we move forward and start lifting the foot off the ground, we supinate (arch raises, foot becomes more \"rigid\" in order to have something stable to push off from). Without an arch, it'd be more difficult to propel forward. We still would be able to obviously, but now you force other parts of your extremities (ie shin splints, anyone?) to help get you forward. Not to mention the absence of an arch in a flatter foot can cause the ground reactive force to move up your next joints (ankle, knee) and potentially cause pain.\n\ntl;dr -  need an arch to push-off and move forward efficiently\n\nSorry if that wasn't very ELI5-ish, and it gets way more detailed and complicated than that, but hopefully that helps!", "Lets talk about force for a minute.  In the short term, force really only has negative, damaging effects on the human body if it is applied very quickly.  A quick anecdote:\n\nImagine that two people jump off a bridge.  \n\nThe first jumps off without any safety equipment.  The force of gravity increases his speed and eventually, he is decelerated in a fraction of a second as he hits the ground.  Obviously death occurs.\n\nThe second jumps off the bridge, the force of gravity increases his speed to a point that it could kill him if he hit the ground, BUT he's wearing a bungee cord.  That bungee cord decelerates this individual over a period of several seconds, over a longer distance.  Because the bungee cord increased both the time and distance at which the force acted, this second (much smarter) person endured no bodily harm.\n\nThe arches in the foot act in a similar way to the bungee cord.  As the heel and toes hit the ground, the center of the foot is still raised up because it is the top of the arch.  As weight is transferred completely to the foot, the arch compresses and partially collapses until it reaches an almost flat state. This period of collapse for the arch increased both the time and distance at which the forces of walking/running acted on the bones and soft tissues of the foot.  If there were no arches in the feet, the force of walking/running would act on the foot much more instantaneously, resulting in damage to the feet - especially over years and decades of use.", "It's all evolution. It wasn't so long ago that there was no flat surface on Earth, as well as the fact that shoes in the grand scheme of things, are reletively new inventions (as far as humans go).\n\nOur feet were arched to help us balance/better traverse terrain that was rocky and uneven. Our feet would confirm to the ground we were standing on, and would build natural muscle and cartilage so that it wouldn't really hurt us.\n\nEnter footwear. Our feet are now padded, and so that muscle/cartilage isn't built up anymore, and our feet hurt like hell if we go out walking barefoot on basically any ground that isn't solid.

This requires a stiffer, stronger foot, which you get by letting your ankle roll slightly to the inside.\n\nYour arch is designed so that those little rolls, called Supination when you roll to the outside and Pronation when you roll inside, lock and unlock the bones of your foot.  Unlocked makes accepting weight easier, locked makes pushing off easier.\n\nThis is a simplified version of one answer from a doctoral student in physical therapy, so I'm sure a lot of these other answers are correct about the evolutionary or anthropological rational for arches.", "I am not an orthopedic doctor but, I do have some pedorthic training because of my line of work.

It was an awesome program but YouTube pulled it...  anyway they showed several tendons on the bottom of the foot that attached to the heel and we're \"loaded\" (like a tightly pulled rubber band) when the toes were lifted.  This created a powerful energy release when unloaded.  They replicated the mechanism with wood and rubber bands and the thing would practically jump off the table.

I've also read many studies on running that suggest the heels only other purpose \"than I previously mentioned\" may be something to rest on when standing for prolonged periods of time.", "If our feet were flat we would need to have stronger bones in our feet and more muscles in our legs. Having flat feet means your feet are taking the blunt force of your body weight and force exerted on it from running or jumping or whatever. Having an arch allows us to have lighter more agile feet that can withstand great forces and allows us to run farther. The arch dissipates the forces exerted on it over the area of the entire foot and slows down the foot as it impacts the ground. If we didn't have arches the foot would need to be heavier to withstand the same loads and as a result we would exert more energy to move our legs.", "Actually no. Think about it from an architecture/engineering point of view. Arches are awesome because they can support a ton of weight and they're also springy.

Here are some reasons why we have arches in our feet:\n1. Supports the body weight: The arches in our feet help distribute the weight of our body evenly across the foot, reducing pressure on any one area. This helps prevent fatigue and discomfort during activities like standing or walking.\n2. Facilitates movement: The arches act as a springboard, absorbing shock and providing cushioning as we move. This helps reduce the impact on our joints and muscles, allowing us to move more efficiently and with less strain.\n3. Maintains balance: The arches play a crucial role in maintaining balance and stability. They help us adjust to uneven surfaces and changes in terrain, preventing us from tripping or falling.\n4. Provides flexibility: The arches allow for flexibility in the foot, enabling us to bend and twist during activities like running or jumping.\n5. Protects the joints: The arches help protect the joints in the foot by absorbing shock and reducing pressure on the ankles, knees, and hips.\nWhile it's true that having a flat foot or no arch at all could potentially lead to issues like overpronation or plantar fasciitis, it's not necessarily more advantageous to have your weight distributed over the entire surface of the foot. The arches are a vital part of the foot's structure and play a crucial role in our ability to move and maintain balance.\nIt's worth noting that some people may have flatter arches or no arches due to genetics, injury, or other factors. In these cases, orthotics or shoe inserts can help redistribute the weight and provide additional support to alleviate any discomfort or issues.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.3453237410071942, "rouge2": 0.09156626506024096, "rougeL": 0.18705035971223022, "rougeLsum": 0.2446043165467626}, "known": true}

They are made up of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and X-rays. The solar rays are produced by the nuclear reactions that occur within the sun's core, where hydrogen atoms are fused together to form helium. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light and heat, which is then radiated outward from the sun's core through its outer layers.\nThere are several different types of solar rays, including:\n1. Visible light rays: These are the rays that we can see with our eyes and are responsible for the colors of the sun.\n2. Ultraviolet (UV) rays: These are rays with shorter wavelengths than visible light and are invisible to the human eye. UV rays can cause sunburn and are also a source of skin cancer.\n3. X-rays: These are high-energy rays with even shorter wavelengths than UV rays. X-rays can pass through human tissue and are often used in medical imaging.\n4. Gamma rays: These are the highest-energy rays in the solar spectrum, with wavelengths shorter than X-rays.

Gravity pulls the object downward, while friction resist the object's motion in a particular direction. Elasticity is the ability of an object to deform and then return to its original shape when the force acting upon it is removed.\nWhen an object comes into contact with an obstacle or a surface, the forces acting upon it change. The object may experience a force that pushes it away from the obstacle or surface, known as the normal force, or a force that slows it down or stops it altogether, known as the frictional force.\nThe normal force is caused by the interaction between the object's surface and the surface of the obstacle or surface it is moving towards. The frictional force is caused by the resistance of the surface to the object's motion. The magnitude of these forces depends on several factors, including the mass of the object, the speed at which it is moving, the angle of incidence (the angle at which the object hits the obstacle or surface), and the coefficient of friction, which is a property of the surfaces involved.\nIf the sum of the forces acting upon an object is greater than the object's mass, the object will accelerate in the direction of the net force. If the sum of the forces is equal to the object's mass, the object will stop moving. If the sum of the forces is less than the object's mass, the object will slow down or decelerate.\nIn the case of an object bouncing off an obstacle, the normal force and the frictional force are the primary forces acting upon the object. When the object hits the obstacle, the normal force pushes it away from the obstacle, while the frictional force slows it down or stops it. Depending on the angle of incidence and the coefficient of friction, the object may bounce off the obstacle or stick to it.\nIn summary, things bounce instead of stopping when they come into contact with an obstacle or a surface because of the interactions between the object and the forces acting upon it, including the normal force, the frictional force, and the", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.2896764252696456, "rouge2": 0.05873261205564141, "rougeL": 0.15408320493066255, "rougeLsum": 0.23728813559322035}, "known": true}

He built a temple on the site of the spring and dedicated it to the goddess Sulis, who was believed to have healing powers. The city of Bath grew up around the temple, and it became a popular destination for people seeking healing and relaxation.\nWhile there is no historical evidence to confirm the existence of King Bladud, the legend of his discovery of the hot springs and founding of Bath has been passed down through the centuries and remains an important part of the city's folklore.", "known": true}

In spurts of feeling."], "llama7b_without_search_answer": " The association of certain organs with specific emotions and bodily sensations is a complex phenomenon that has evolved over time through a combination of cultural, historical, and biological factors. Here are some possible reasons why certain organs are associated with certain feelings:\n1. Ancient beliefs and mythology: In many cultures, the heart has been associated with emotions and love because it was believed to be the seat of the soul or the source of life. In ancient Egyptian and Greek mythology, the heart was seen as the organ that controlled a person's emotions and passions. Similarly, the brain was seen as the source of intelligence and rational thinking.\n2. Physical sensations: The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body, and its rhythmic beating can be felt throughout the chest. This physical sensation may have led to the association of the heart with emotional experiences, such as love and joy. Similarly, the brain is responsible for processing sensory information and generating emotions, which may explain why it is associated with thoughts and cognitive processes.\n3. Language and metaphor: Many languages use metaphors and idioms that associate emotions with specific organs. For example, the English language uses the phrase \"heartbreak\" to describe the emotional pain of a broken relationship, and \"brain fog\" to describe confusion or forgetfulness. These metaphors can become ingrained in culture and influence how people think about emotions and their origins.\n4. Cultural conditioning: Our cultural beliefs and values can shape our perceptions of emotions and their associated organs. For example, in Western cultures, the heart is often seen as the symbol of love and emotions, while in Eastern cultures, the liver is associated with emotions and feelings. This cultural conditioning can lead to different associations between organs and emotions across different cultures.\n5. Evolutionary explanations: Some scientists suggest that the association of emotions with specific organs may have evolutionary roots. For example, the heart is a vital organ that is essential for survival, and the brain is responsible for regulating the body's stress response. Over time, these physiological processes may have influenced the way we experience and express emotions.\n6. Brain function: The brain is a complex organ that processes emotions, memories, and sens", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.2824302134646962, "rouge2": 0.05601317957166392, "rougeL": 0.13793103448275862, "rougeLsum": 0.2430213464696223}, "known": true}

Here are some possible consequences:\n1. No clear winner: Without any votes, there would be no clear winner in the election, as there would be no data to determine who received the most votes. This could lead to a constitutional crisis or a delay in the election process.\n2. Lack of representation: Without voters, there would be no representation for the electorate in the government. This could result in a lack of accountability and responsiveness to the needs and concerns of the people.\n3. Disenfranchisement of voters: If nobody votes, it could be seen as a form of disenfranchisement of voters, as their voices would not be heard in the election. This could lead to a loss of trust in the democratic process and a decrease in voter turnout in future elections.\n4. Increased polarization: Without a clear winner, the election could become increasingly polarized, as different groups may try to assert their influence and control over the government. This could lead to a breakdown in communication and cooperation between different political groups.\n5. Constitutional issues: The lack of a clear winner could raise constitutional issues, such as the legitimacy of the government and the ability of the elected officials to make decisions on behalf of the people.\n6. International implications: The lack of a clear winner could also have international implications, as other countries may view the situation as a sign of instability or weakness in the democratic system. This could impact international relations and the global perception of the country's democracy.\n7. Election irregularities: Without voters, there may be a lack of oversight and accountability in the election process, which could lead to irregularities and fraud.\n8.

Here are some reasons why certain areas may be considered uninhabitable for centuries after a nuclear accident, while others like Hiroshima are habitable:\n1. Radiation exposure: The primary concern after a nuclear accident is the exposure of people to ionizing radiation, which can cause genetic mutations, cancer, and other health problems. Areas with high levels of radiation, such as those near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, may be considered uninhabitable for extended periods due to the potential health risks. In contrast, areas with lower levels of radiation, like Hiroshima, may be considered habitable after a shorter period.\n2. Radioactive contamination: Radioactive materials can persist in the environment for years or even decades after a nuclear accident, contaminating soil, water, and air. Areas with high levels of radioactive contamination may be considered uninhabitable until the contamination can be removed or reduced through remediation efforts. For example, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan led to widespread radioactive contamination, making many areas uninhabitable for extended periods.\n3. Economic and social factors: The economic and social impact of a nuclear accident can also affect the habitability of an area. For example, areas with limited resources, infrastructure, or social support may be more difficult to restore or rebuild after a nuclear accident, making them less habitable in the short or long term. In contrast, areas with stronger economic and social structures, like Hiroshima, may be better equipped to recover and rebuild after a nuclear accident.\n4. Remediation efforts: The effectiveness of remediation efforts can also impact the habitability of an area after a nuclear accident. Areas where significant progress has been made in removing radioactive materials, restoring ecosystems, and rebuilding infrastructure may be considered more habitable than areas where remediation efforts have been less successful.\n5. Time: The longer time passes after a nuclear accident, the more radioactive materials will decay, and the lower the radiation levels will become. This means that areas that were once considered unin", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.22103386809269163, "rouge2": 0.04293381037567084, "rougeL": 0.12121212121212122, "rougeLsum": 0.14260249554367202}, "known": false}

The Homestead Act of 1862: This federal law provided land grants to settlers who were willing to farm the land, which led to a large influx of settlers moving west.\n2. The construction of the transcontinental railroad (1869): The completion of the transcontinental railroad connected the east and west coasts of the United States, making it easier and faster for people and goods to travel across the country, and marking the end of the need for overland trails.\n3. The Dawes Act of 1887: This federal law divided Indian reservations into individual allotments, which were then sold to non-Native Americans, leading to the loss of tribal land and the assimilation of Native Americans into mainstream American society.\n4. The Oklahoma Land Runs of 1889: These series of land runs, in which settlers raced to claim land in the newly opened Oklahoma Territory, marked the end of the open range and the beginning of the settled agricultural economy in the region.\n5. The Spanish-American War (1898): This conflict marked the beginning of the United States' emergence as a global power, and the end of the \"Wild West\" era.\nIt's worth noting that the \"Wild West\" was a complex and multifaceted period in American history, and its end was a gradual process that occurred over several decades.

There were no subscriptions to network TV or radio, so they started out by having each show sponsored by one or a few sponsors.  \n\nThe problem was that gave a lot of power to those few sponsors.  Rod Serling, creator of The Twilight Zone, complained about being forced to make script changes because the sponsors weren't happy (and they were allowed a review of the script).  For example, he had to change the line \"Got a match?\" because the show's sponsor made lighters.  \n\nThe time dedicated toward ads increased as networks increased broadcasting strength, the expenses for the shows increased and as studios/networks/advertisers pushed to make more money.  \n\nThere are also local affiliates in the US.

Here are some key factors that have contributed to the current state of television:\n1. The rise of cable and satellite TV: In the 1980s and 1990s, cable and satellite TV providers began offering a wider range of channels than traditional broadcast TV. This led to a proliferation of channels and a shift away from the traditional three major networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC). Cable and satellite providers offered more niche programming, including sports, news, and entertainment channels, which attracted viewers who were willing to pay for additional channels.\n2. The advent of streaming services: In the early 2000s, streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime began offering on-demand content to subscribers. These services allowed viewers to watch shows and movies whenever they wanted, without the need for a traditional TV schedule. This disrupted the traditional TV model and gave viewers more control over what they watched and when.\n3. The rise of ad-supported streaming services: As streaming services became more popular, advertisers began to see them as a viable platform for reaching audiences. Ad-supported streaming services like Hulu and YouTube began to offer a mix of free and paid content, with ads inserted into the programming. This model allowed viewers to watch content for free, but with the trade-off of watching ads.\n4. The shift to digital distribution: As more and more content is distributed digitally, the traditional TV model has become less relevant. Streaming services and social media platforms have made it easier for creators to distribute their content directly to viewers, bypassing traditional TV networks. This has led to a proliferation of independent content creators and a shift away from the traditional TV model.\n5. The rise of the \"peak TV\" era: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of TV content, with more channels and streaming services offering a wider range of programming than ever before. This has led to the term \"peak TV,\" which refers to the idea that there is simply too much content available, making it harder for shows to stand out and attract viewers.\n6.

Suggest they drink water before, during, and after physical activity, and offer water-rich foods like soup or fruit.\n3. Provide cooling measures: Keep your elderly loved ones' living space cool by using fans, air conditioners, or misting devices. You can also provide cool compresses or cold packs to help lower body temperature.\n4. Avoid strenuous activities: Encourage your elderly loved ones to avoid strenuous activities during the hottest part of the day and to take regular breaks in a cool, shaded area.\n5. Monitor their health: Keep an eye on your elderly loved ones' health and watch for signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke, such as dizziness, nausea, headache, or confusion. If you notice any of these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.\n6. Dress appropriately: Dress your elderly loved ones in lightweight, light-colored clothing that allows for good airflow and helps keep them cool. Avoid heavy, dark clothing that can trap heat.\n7. Use sunscreen: Apply sunscreen to your elderly loved ones' skin to protect them from the sun's harmful rays. Choose a sunscreen with a high SPF and apply it regularly throughout the day.\n8. Keep them informed: Stay informed about the heat index and weather forecasts in your area, and share this information with your elderly loved ones.

Historical significance: Many banks that were established in the late 19th and early 20th centuries adopted the name \"First National Bank of ...\" as a way to convey their status as one of the first banks in their respective regions or communities. At the time, national banking laws required banks to have a unique name that included the word \"National,\" so the phrase \"First National Bank of ...\" was used to distinguish these banks from later establishments.\n2. Branding and identity: The name \"First National Bank of ...\" has become a recognizable and trustworthy brand for many banks, particularly those that have been in operation for a long time. It conveys a sense of stability, reliability, and tradition, which can be important factors in building customer loyalty and trust.\n3. Legal requirements: In some jurisdictions, banks are still required by law to include the words \"National Bank\" or \"National Association\" in their names, even if they are not actually owned by the federal government. This is the case in the United States, where national banks are chartered by the federal government but are also subject to state regulation.\n4. Marketing strategy: Some banks may choose to use the name \"First National Bank of ...\" as part of a marketing strategy to emphasize their local focus and commitment to the community. By including the name of the city or region in their title, these banks can create a sense of connection with their customers and reinforce their reputation as a community-based institution.\n5. Mergers and acquisitions: When banks merge or are acquired, they may retain the name \"First National Bank of ...\" as a way to maintain continuity and consistency with their existing branding and customer base. This can help to avoid confusion and ensure a smooth transition for customers and employees.\n\nOverall, the use of \"First National Bank of ...\" in the title of banks is a combination of historical, legal, and marketing factors that have evolved over time. While the specific reasons may vary depending on the bank and its circumstances, the name has become a common and recognizable feature of the banking industry.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.09290953545232274, "rouge2": 0.024570024570024572, "rougeL": 0.07823960880195599, "rougeLsum": 0.07823960880195599}, "known": false}

Here are some reasons why there are so many unaffiliated police departments in the US:\n1. Historical development: The US has a long history of local government and law enforcement, dating back to the colonial era. As cities and towns grew and developed, they established their own police departments to provide law enforcement services to their communities. This tradition of local control has continued to the present day.\n2. Political considerations: Law enforcement is often seen as a local issue, and citizens prefer to have their police departments close to home, where they can be more responsive to community needs. Local elected officials, such as mayors or county commissioners, are often responsible for appointing or electing the heads of local law enforcement agencies, which further reinforces the idea of local control.\n3. Jurisdictional boundaries: The US has a complex system of municipal, county, and state governments, each with its own jurisdiction and law enforcement agencies. In many cases, these agencies overlap or share responsibilities, leading to multiple layers of law enforcement.\n4. Funding and resource allocation: Local governments have more control over how law enforcement funds are allocated and spent, which can result in variations in the size, equipment, and training of local police departments.\n5. Community policing and accountability: Local law enforcement agencies are often better positioned to understand and respond to the unique needs of their communities. They are also more accountable to the citizens they serve, as they are directly elected or appointed by local officials.\n6. Flexibility and adaptability: Having multiple unaffiliated police departments allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in responding to changing crime trends and community needs.\n7. Legal and constitutional considerations: The US Constitution and various federal and state laws provide for the existence of multiple law enforcement agencies. For example, the federal government has its own law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), but local agencies still have their own jurisdiction and authority.\n8", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.32748538011695905, "rouge2": 0.04692082111436951, "rougeL": 0.15497076023391812, "rougeLsum": 0.26608187134502925}, "known": true}

Here are some of the most notable ones:\n1. Monasteries: Monastic institutions played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge during the Middle Ages. Many monasteries had scriptoria, or writing rooms, where monks copied and illuminated manuscripts. These monasteries were often located in remote areas, away from urban centers, which helped to preserve their intellectual and cultural heritage. Examples of influential monasteries include St. Gall in Switzerland, Bobbio in Italy, and Whitby in England.\n2. Universities: The first universities emerged in Europe during the High Middle Ages (11th-13th centuries). These included the University of Bologna (founded in 1088), the University of Paris (founded in 1150), and the University of Oxford (founded in 1167). These institutions were initially focused on the study of law, but later expanded to include other subjects such as theology, philosophy, and medicine.\n3. Cathedral schools: Many cathedrals in Europe had schools attached to them, which provided education to boys from noble families. These schools were often staffed by scholars who had studied at the universities or monasteries. Examples of influential cathedral schools include the School of Chartres in France and the School of Durham in England.\n4. Royal courts: The royal courts of Europe were also centers of learning, particularly during the 12th and 13th centuries. The court of King Henry II of England, for example, was known for its scholars and poets, while the court of King Louis IX of France was renowned for its theologians and philosophers.\n5. Merchant guilds: In some cities, merchant guilds also played a role in promoting learning. For example, the Hanseatic League, a confederation of merchant guilds in Northern Europe, supported the establishment of schools and libraries.\n6. Royal palaces: Some royal palaces, such as the Palace of Westminster in England, were also centers of learning. The palace housed the royal library, which contained many important manuscripts and books.\n7. Public libraries: A few public libraries", "known": true}

Duration of Residency: The duration of a residency program varies depending on the specialty and country. In the United States, most residency programs last between three to seven years.\n3. Application Process: The application process for residency programs typically involves the following steps:\n* Registering for the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) or the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMs)\n* Submitting your medical school transcripts, USMLE or COMLEX scores, and letters of recommendation.\n* Taking the required exams for your specialty (e.g., USMLE Step 1 and Step 2, or COMLEX Level 1 and Level 2).\n* Interviewing at the residency programs you are interested in.\n4. Interview Process: The interview process for residency programs typically involves a series of interviews with program faculty, as well as tours of the hospital and opportunities to meet with current residents.\n5. Matching Process: After completing the interview process, applicants are matched with a residency program through the NRMP or CaRMs. The matching process takes into account the preferences of both the applicant and the program, with the goal of matching the best candidate with the best program.\n6. Benefits of Residency: Completing a residency program offers several benefits, including:\n* Gaining hands-on experience in your chosen specialty.\n* Developing advanced clinical skills and knowledge.\n* Networking with other healthcare professionals in your field.\n* Building a strong foundation for a career in medicine.\n7", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.21029082774049215, "rouge2": 0.03595505617977528, "rougeL": 0.10290827740492169, "rougeLsum": 0.16554809843400445}, "known": false}

Adding dry to wet makes mixing easier and faster as opposed way creates dry clumps, that require extra mixing. thats why dry to wet is preferred cause it makes things easier and faster."], "llama7b_without_search_answer": " The order in which you mix things together can matter for several reasons:\n\n1. **Chemical reactions:** In chemical reactions, the order of mixing can affect the speed and efficiency of the reaction. Some reactions may require a specific order of mixing to occur, while others may be affected by the timing of mixing. For example, in a chemical reaction, mixing two substances together in the wrong order can lead to a reaction that produces unwanted byproducts or doesn't produce the desired product at all.\n2. **Phase separation:** When mixing two or more substances with different phases (such as liquids, solids, or gases), the order in which they are mixed can affect whether they separate or mix together properly. For example, if you mix a liquid and a solid together, the solid may settle to the bottom of the container before the liquid is fully incorporated, leading to an uneven mixture.\n3. **Particle size distribution:** The order in which you mix particles of different sizes can affect their distribution within the final mixture. For example, if you mix large particles first and then add smaller particles, the larger particles may settle to the bottom of the container before the smaller particles have a chance to distribute evenly, leading to an uneven mixture.\n4. **Agglomeration:** Agglomeration occurs when particles stick together to form larger clusters. The order in which you mix particles can affect the likelihood of agglomeration occurring, as well as the size and shape of the resulting clusters. For example, if you mix small particles together first and then add larger particles, the smaller particles may cluster together before being covered by the larger particles, leading to an uneven mixture.\n5. **Rheology:** Rheology refers to the study of the flow and deformation of materials. The order in which you mix materials can affect their rheological properties, such as their viscosity and elasticity. For example, if you mix a thick, viscous liquid with a thinner liquid, the thicker liquid may resist the flow of the thinner liquid, leading to an uneven mixture.\n6. **Mixing time:** The order in which you mix materials can also affect the mixing time required to achieve a uniform mixture. For example, if you mix two substances together in a specific order, the mixture may be more likely to be", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.08715596330275228, "rouge2": 0.0, "rougeL": 0.05045871559633027, "rougeLsum": 0.05963302752293577}, "known": false}

In the United States, military patents are governed by Title 35 of the United States Code, which covers patents and trademarks. Here is an overview of how military patents are enforced and why it's important to obtain a patent for military-related inventions:\n\nEnforcement of Military Patents:\nThe United States Department of Defense (DoD) has its own patent system, which is separate from the regular patent system. The DoD Patent Office is responsible for examining and granting patents for inventions related to military technology. Once a patent is granted, the DoD can enforce it against unauthorized use of the invention by the military or by third parties.\nThe DoD can take legal action against individuals or companies that infringe on a military patent. This can include filing lawsuits, seeking injunctions, or seeking damages for the infringement. The DoD also has the authority to license its patents to other organizations or individuals, which can provide a source of revenue for the military.\nWhy Bother to Make a Patent?\nThere are several reasons why it's important to obtain a patent for a military-related invention:\n1. Exclusive Rights: A patent gives the inventor exclusive rights to make, use, and sell the invention for a certain period of time. This means that no one else can legally make or use the invention without permission from the patent holder.\n2. Financial Benefits: By obtaining a patent, the inventor can license the invention to other organizations or individuals, which can provide a source of revenue.\n3. National Security: Military patents are important for national security because they can help protect the military's technology and intellectual property from being stolen or copied by foreign governments or terrorist organizations.\n4. Competitive Advantage: Obtaining a patent can give the military a competitive advantage over other countries or organizations that may be developing similar technologies.\n5. Recognition and Credibility: A patent can provide recognition and credibility for the inventor and the military organization. It can also help to establish the military as a leader in a particular field or technology.\n", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.16771488469601675, "rouge2": 0.042105263157894736, "rougeL": 0.10482180293501049, "rougeLsum": 0.1551362683438155}, "known": false}

The British had been successful in defeating Hull's forces at the Battle of Lake Erie earlier in the war, but Hull had retreated to Fort Malden with a small number of troops.\nOn June 6, Sheaffe's forces marched towards Fort Malden, pursuing Hull's retreating army. The American forces had set up a defensive position along Stoney Creek, a small stream that flows into Lake Erie. Despite being outnumbered, Hull's forces held their ground against the British attack, repelling several attempts to cross the creek.\nAfter several hours of fighting, Sheaffe's forces managed to find a shallow crossing point and launched a successful attack on the American positions. Hull's forces were forced to retreat, leaving behind many dead and wounded soldiers. The British suffered relatively light casualties, with around 20 killed or wounded.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Hull's forces retreated to Detroit, where they were later defeated by Sheaffe's forces in the Battle of Detroit. The Battle of Stoney Creek was a significant British victory in the War of 1812, as it prevented the American forces from gaining control of the important port of Detroit and secured British control of the region.", "known": false}

Here's a simplified overview of the RO process:\n\n1. Pre-treatment: The raw seawater is first pre-treated to remove any suspended solids, bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants that could damage the RO membranes or interfere with the desalination process. This step may involve physical treatment processes such as screening, sedimentation, and filtration.\n2. Desalination: The pre-treated seawater is then forced through a series of semi-permeable RO membranes under pressure. The membranes have tiny pores that allow water molecules to pass through, but block larger salt ions and other impurities. As the water flows through the membranes, the salt and other impurities are rejected and flushed away as a concentrated brine solution.\n3. Post-treatment: After the desalination process, the freshwater is treated with chemicals to adjust its pH level and remove any remaining impurities. This helps to prevent corrosion and scaling in the distribution system.\n4. Reverse Osmosis Membrane: The reverse osmosis membrane is the heart of the desalination process. It is a thin, semi-permeable film that separates the salt and other impurities from the water. The membrane has tiny pores that allow water molecules to pass through, but block larger salt ions and other impurities.\n5. Energy Recovery: The energy recovery system used in Australian desalination plants is typically a multi-stage flash distillation (MSF) system. This system uses the heat generated by the desalination process to produce steam, which is then used to power turbines and generate electricity.\n6. Disinfection: Finally, the freshwater is disinfected using chlorine or ozone to kill any remaining bacteria or viruses.\nIt's worth noting that there are other desalination methods used in Australia, such as electrodialysis reversal (EDR) and nanofiltration (NF), but RO is the most common method due to its high efficiency and low energy consumption.", "known": true}

However, there are some common reasons why a spider might sit on a wall for an extended period of time. Here are some possible explanations:\n1. Waiting for prey: Many spiders are predators that feed on insects, and they often sit on walls or other surfaces to wait for prey to come close. They may use their excellent eyesight or sense of vibration to detect movement and locate potential prey.\n2. Resting: Spiders need to rest and recharge their energy after hunting or web-building activities. Sitting on a wall can provide them with a safe and comfortable spot to rest and digest their meals.\n3. Basking: Some spiders, particularly those that live in warm climates, bask in the sun on walls or other surfaces to regulate their body temperature. This helps them to stay warm and active, especially during cooler periods.\n4. Communication: Some species of spiders use their body language and positioning to communicate with other spiders. They may sit on a wall to signal their presence or intentions to other spiders in the area.\n5. Camouflage: Some spiders have a tendency to sit on walls or other surfaces to blend in with their surroundings. This can help them to avoid detection by predators or prey, or to sneak up on unsuspecting insects.\n6. Mating: Male spiders may sit on walls or other surfaces to attract females or to defend their territory from other males.\n7. Egg-laying: Female spiders may sit on walls or other surfaces to lay their eggs in a safe and secure location. They may also use this position to protect their eggs from predators or to keep them moist.\nIt's worth noting that different species of spiders may exhibit different behaviors, so the reasons why a spider sits on a wall may depend on the specific species of spider.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.1715686274509804, "rouge2": 0.019704433497536946, "rougeL": 0.09313725490196079, "rougeLsum": 0.1323529411764706}, "known": false}

Temperature changes: When an object is wet, it tends to feel cooler to the touch than when it is dry. This temperature difference can be perceived through the gloves, even if the gloves themselves do not allow for the direct transfer of tactile sensations.\n2. Sensory substitution: The brain can use sensory information from other sources to make up for the lack of direct sensory input. For example, if someone is wearing gloves and touches a wet surface, their brain may use the sensation of pressure or weight to infer the wetness of the surface, even if they cannot feel the direct sensation of wetness through the gloves.\n3. Contextual cues: People may be able to infer the wetness of an object based on the context in which they are interacting with it. For example, if someone is holding a wet object and feels the weight of the water, they may be able to infer that the object is wet even if they cannot feel the direct sensation of wetness through the gloves.\n4. Accelerometers and force sensors: Some gloves have accelerometers or force sensors that can detect the movement or pressure of the wearer's hand, even through the gloves. These sensors can provide information about the texture or wetness of an object, even if the direct sensation is not felt through the gloves.\nIt's worth noting that the ability to perceive the wetness of an object through gloves can vary depending on the type of gloves being used, the material of the object being touched, and the individual's sensory perception.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.05649717514124294, "rouge2": 0.0, "rougeL": 0.05084745762711864, "rougeLsum": 0.03954802259887005}, "known": false}

The feast was established by Pope Leo XIII in 1895, and has been observed since then as a way to honor Mary's unique position in the Christian faith.\nDuring the Mass on this day, the Church prays for Mary's intercession and asks for her blessing, asking that she may help us to grow in holiness and to follow her example of devotion to God.

They have a complex and tumultuous history, and their political, economic, and social systems are vastly different. Here are some key differences between the two countries:\n1. Political System: North Korea is a totalitarian communist state, ruled by the Kim family since 1948. The government tightly controls all aspects of society, including the media, education, and economy. South Korea, on the other hand, is a democracy with a president, prime minister, and a bicameral legislature.\n2. Economy: South Korea has a market-oriented economy and is one of the Four Asian Tigers, along with Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. It has a highly developed manufacturing sector and is a major exporter of electronics, automobiles, and shipbuilding. North Korea, on the other hand, has a planned economy and is heavily dependent on agriculture, mining, and energy production. The country has been subject to international sanctions due to its nuclear weapons program, which has had a severe impact on its economy.\n3. Social Issues: South Korea has made significant progress in terms of social welfare and human rights. The country has a high life expectancy, low infant mortality rate, and free education and healthcare systems. North Korea, on the other hand, has a poor human rights record, with reports of forced labor, political imprisonment, and widespread poverty.\n4. International Relations: South Korea has a close relationship with the United States and is a key ally in the region. The country is also a member of the United Nations, the G-20, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). North Korea, on the other hand, is isolated from the international community and has been subject to economic sanctions due to its nuclear weapons program.\n5. Military: South Korea has a large and well-equipped military, with a mandatory conscription system that requires all able-bodied men to serve for two years. North Korea, on the other hand, has a smaller military, but it is highly centralized and loyal to the ruling party. The country has also developed nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, which pose a significant threat to South Korea and the rest of the world.\n6.

Here are some reasons why water pipes don't typically burst after you turn off the sink or hose:\n1. Materials: Modern water pipes are made of durable materials such as copper, PVC, or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), which are resistant to cracking and bursting under normal water pressure conditions.\n2. Design and installation: Water pipes are designed and installed with proper slope and pressure relief valves to prevent excessive pressure buildup. The pipes are also insulated to reduce heat transfer and prevent freezing in colder climates.\n3. Hydraulic design: The layout of the water distribution system is designed to minimize pressure fluctuations and ensure that water flows smoothly through the pipes. This includes the use of larger pipes in areas where there is a high demand for water, as well as the use of smaller pipes in areas where the demand is lower.\n4. Pressure regulation: Many homes have pressure regulators that help maintain a consistent water pressure throughout the home. These regulators can adjust the water pressure to a safe level, preventing excessive pressure buildup that could cause a pipe to burst.\n5. Age and maintenance: Older pipes may be more prone to bursting due to corrosion or wear and tear. Regular maintenance, such as flushing and inspecting the pipes, can help identify potential problems before they become serious.\n6. Water hammer: When you turn off a faucet or hose quickly, it can create a sudden drop in water pressure that can cause a \"water hammer\" effect. This can lead to vibrations and noise in the pipes, but it doesn't typically cause a pipe to burst.\n7. Pipe material properties: Some materials, like copper, have a higher elastic modulus than others, meaning they can stretch and deform more without breaking under pressure. This property helps copper pipes absorb pressure changes without bursting.\n8. Pipe thickness: Thicker pipes are less likely to burst than thinner ones, as they have more material to absorb pressure changes.\n9. Joint design: Properly designed and installed joints can help distribute pressure evenly across the pipe, reducing", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.19954648526077098, "rouge2": 0.03189066059225513, "rougeL": 0.10884353741496598, "rougeLsum": 0.14058956916099774}, "known": false}

Of course, speaking and singing have far more complicated waveforms, but the general idea is the same."], "llama7b_without_search_answer": " Singing and speaking are both forms of vocal communication, but they involve different physiological processes and produce distinct sounds. Here are some key differences:\n1. Vocal Folds: Singing involves the use of the vocal folds, which are two bands of muscle tissue located in the larynx (voice box). When you sing, you use your diaphragm to breathe air into your lungs, which causes the vocal folds to vibrate and produce sound waves. Speaking, on the other hand, does not involve the vocal folds. Instead, the tongue, lips, and other soft tissues of the mouth and throat are used to articulate sounds.\n2. Pitch: Singing is characterized by a wide range of pitches, while speaking is generally limited to a narrower range of pitches. This is because the vocal folds are more flexible and can produce a wider range of frequencies when singing.\n3. Resonance: Singing often involves the use of resonance, which is the way the sound is shaped and modified by the head, neck, and chest cavities. Resonance can add depth, warmth, and character to the voice. Speaking does not typically involve resonance in the same way.\n4. Articulation: Speaking involves the use of the tongue, lips, and other soft tissues of the mouth and throat to articulate sounds. Singing also involves articulation, but the articulation is often more precise and controlled.\n5. Breath control: Singing requires better breath control than speaking, as singers need to be able to sustain notes and control their breathing for longer periods of time.\n6. Vocal Registers: Singing involves the use of different vocal registers, such as the chest voice, head voice, and mixed voice, which are produced by different parts of the vocal tract. Speaking does not typically involve these different registers.\n7. Dynamics: Singing can involve a wide range of dynamics, including soft and loud sounds, while speaking is generally more limited in terms of dynamic range.\n8. Emotion: Singing is often used to convey emotion and express feelings, while speaking is more focused on conveying information and ideas.\nNow, are you actually producing a note when you speak? The answer is yes and no. When you speak, you are producing sound waves", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.2813102119460501, "rouge2": 0.04642166344294004, "rougeL": 0.15028901734104047, "rougeLsum": 0.23506743737957608}, "known": true}

Here are some reasons why this might be the case:\n1. Distance and resolution limitations: As you mentioned, Pluto is very far away from Earth, located at a distance of about 39.5 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. This means that even with the most advanced telescopes and spacecraft, we can only observe Pluto indirectly, by detecting the faint light it reflects or emits. The farther away an object is, the more difficult it becomes to resolve its details, including its size.\n2. Limited data: While we have sent several spacecraft to explore the outer Solar System, including the New Horizons probe that flew by Pluto in 2015, these missions have only provided us with a limited amount of data about the dwarf planet. For example, New Horizons imaged Pluto's surface at a resolution of about 100 meters per pixel, which is not enough to determine its size with great precision.\n3. Complexity of Pluto's shape: Pluto has a highly irregular shape, with a rotationally-symmetric elongated form that is difficult to model accurately. Its surface is also characterized by numerous craters, mountains, and other geological features that can make it challenging to estimate its overall size.\n4. Lack of reference points: Without a known reference point on Pluto, such as a large impact basin or a distinctive feature, it is difficult to determine its size relative to other objects in the Solar System. This makes it harder to estimate its diameter or volume, especially when dealing with a small and irregularly-shaped body like Pluto.\n5. Methodological limitations: Scientists use various methods to estimate the size of celestial bodies, including direct imaging, spectroscopy, and gravitational measurements. However, these methods are not always straightforward or reliable, especially when dealing with distant objects like Pluto. For example, spectroscopic measurements may be affected by atmospheric distortion or instrumental errors, while gravitational measurements require precise knowledge of the object's mass", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.402332361516035, "rouge2": 0.04970760233918129, "rougeL": 0.14868804664723032, "rougeLsum": 0.30903790087463556}, "known": true}

Here are some of the key contributors to the development of the modern SNDI model:\n1. Chandrasekhar (1958): Chandrasekhar (1958) proposed the first model of the solar nebula instability, which he attributed to the gravitational collapse of a rotating, dense cloud of gas and dust. He showed that the instability could lead to the formation of a protostar and a protoplanetary disk.\n2. Shakura & Sunyaev (1974): Shakura and Sunyaev (1974) developed a more detailed model of the SNDI, which took into account the effects of angular momentum transport and magnetic fields on the instability. They showed that the SNDI could lead to the formation of a wide range of astrophysical structures, including stars, planets, and planetary systems.\n3. Toomre (1964): Toomre (1964) introduced the concept of the \"Toomre parameter,\" which is a measure of the stability of a disk against the SNDI. He showed that the Toomre parameter could be used to predict whether a disk would be unstable to the SNDI, and to estimate the timescale on which the instability would occur.\n4. Lynden-Bell & Pringle (1974): Lynden-Bell and Pringle (1974) developed a model of the SNDI that included the effects of turbulence and magnetic fields on the instability. They showed that turbulence and magnetic fields could significantly affect the stability of a disk and the timescale on which the SNDI occurs.\n5. Nelson (1979): Nelson (1979) developed a model of the SNDI that included the effects of self-gravity and hydrodynamic interactions between the disk and the surrounding medium. He showed that these interactions could significantly affect the stability of the disk and the timescale on which the SNDI occurs.\n6. Adams & Shu (1983): Adams and Shu (1983", "known": false}

The farthest point is called \"apogee,\" which occurs when the Moon is about 405,500 kilometers (252,000 miles) away.\nSo, the amount of time it takes for the Moon to complete one orbit around Earth depends on its distance from Earth.

The concept of time is a complex and multifaceted one, and there are different ways to think about it depending on one's perspective.\nFrom a linear perspective, time can be thought of as a straight line that moves forward in a continuous and unidirectional manner. This is the way we typically experience time in our daily lives, as each moment follows logically after the previous one, and the past is distinct from the present and future.\nHowever, some theories in physics and philosophy suggest that time may not be a linear concept after all. For example, some interpretations of Einstein's theory of relativity propose that time is a four-dimensional fabric that can be curved and warped by the presence of matter and energy. In this view, time is not a fixed, one-way line, but rather a flexible and dynamic structure that can be experienced differently depending on the observer's frame of reference.\nAnother way to think about time is as a spiral or cycle. Many cultures and belief systems have proposed that time is cyclical, with events repeating themselves in a never-ending cycle. For example, some ancient cultures believed in the concept of an eternal return, where the universe and all its events would repeat themselves indefinitely. Similarly, some modern spiritual and philosophical traditions propose that time is a spiral, with events and experiences repeating themselves in a cycle of birth, growth, decay, and rebirth.\nUltimately, the nature of time is still a subject of debate and exploration in philosophy, physics, and other fields. While there are many different perspectives on what time is and how it works, there is no single, definitive answer to the question of whether time is a spiral or a line.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.30991735537190085, "rouge2": 0.07468879668049792, "rougeL": 0.1694214876033058, "rougeLsum": 0.2727272727272727}, "known": true}

The process for calling a special election varies from state to state, but generally follows these steps:\n1. Vacancy occurs: When a Senator dies, resigns, or is expelled from office, a vacancy is created in their seat.\n2. Governor calls a special election: The Governor of the state where the vacancy exists has the authority to call a special election to fill the remaining term of the seat. The Governor typically sets a date for the special election within a few weeks to several months after the vacancy occurs.\n3. Filing period opens: After the special election is called, political parties and candidates have a certain amount of time (usually several weeks) to file their candidacies with the state election officials.\n4. Primary election (if necessary): If there are more than two candidates running for the seat, a primary election is held to narrow down the field to the top two candidates. The primary election is usually held a few weeks before the special election.\n5. Special election: The special election is held on the date set by the Governor, and voters in the affected state cast ballots to choose the new Senator.\n6. Certification of results: After the special election, the state election officials certify the results, and the new Senator is officially seated in the Senate.\nIt's worth noting that some states have different procedures for filling Senate vacancies, so the specifics may vary depending on where you are in the country. For example, some states have a legislative body that can appoint an interim Senator until a special election is held, while others require a special election to be held as soon as possible after the vacancy occurs.", "known": true}

Copyright Infringement: Game developers hold the copyright to their games, including the code, graphics, and gameplay mechanics. Creating and using gameplay hacks without permission can be seen as copyright infringement, which is illegal under copyright law.\n2. Breach of Terms of Service: Most games have terms of service agreements that prohibit cheating, hacking, or any other activity that can give an unfair advantage. Violating these terms can result in account suspension or termination, and may also lead to legal action.\n3. Unfair Competition: Gameplay hacks can give an individual an unfair advantage over other players, which can be seen as unfair competition. This can lead to legal action, particularly if the hacks are used in competitive games or tournaments.\n4. Privacy Violation: Some gameplay hacks, such as aimbots, can collect and transmit player data without their consent. This can be a violation of privacy laws and can lead to legal action.\n5. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA): The CFAA is a federal law that criminalizes unauthorized access to computer systems or networks. Creating and using gameplay hacks that bypass security measures or manipulate game mechanics without permission can be seen as a violation of the CFAA.\n6. State Laws: Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be state laws that prohibit cheating or hacking in video games. For example, some states have laws that make it illegal to use cheats or hacks in online games.\nIt's important to note that game developers often have strict policies against cheating and hacking, and may take legal action against individuals who violate these policies. Additionally, many games have built-in measures to detect and prevent cheating, such as anti-cheat software or automated systems that monitor player behavior.\nIn conclusion, creating and using gameplay hacks without permission from the game developers can result in legal consequences, including lawsuits.

Here is a brief overview of how Pakistan ended up with nuclear weapons:\n1. Post-Independence Security Concerns: After gaining independence from British colonial rule in 1947, Pakistan faced several security challenges, including border disputes with India, which led to four wars between the two countries. These conflicts reinforced Pakistan's belief that it needed a strong military capability to deter Indian aggression.\n2. Cold War Dynamics: During the Cold War, Pakistan became a key ally of the United States and a member of the Western nuclear club. The US provided Pakistan with nuclear technology and fuel, which helped it develop its nuclear program. In return, Pakistan agreed to allow the US to use its territory for military and logistical purposes in the event of a conflict with the Soviet Union.\n3. India's Nuclear Test: In 1974, India conducted a nuclear test, known as Smiling Buddha, which caught Pakistan off guard. This event heightened Pakistan's sense of insecurity and led it to accelerate its own nuclear program.\n4. Nuclear Proliferation: In the 1970s, Pakistan began to seek nuclear technology from various sources, including China, France, and West Germany. However, these efforts were hindered by international pressure and sanctions, which made it difficult for Pakistan to acquire complete nuclear technology.\n5. CIA Assistance: In the early 1980s, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) provided Pakistan with financial and technical assistance to help it develop its nuclear program. This assistance was part of a broader US strategy to counterbalance the Soviet Union's influence in the region.\n6. Nuclear Tests: Pakistan conducted its first nuclear test, known as Chagai-I, on May 28, 1998. This test was followed by a second test, Chagai-II, on May 30, 1998, which demonstrated Pakistan's ability to produce nuclear weapons with a high yield.\n7.

Here's a step-by-step overview of the process:\n1. Germ cells: The process of spermatogenesis begins with the development of germ cells, which are immature cells that have the potential to become either sperm or eggs. These germ cells are produced in the testes through a process called meiosis, which involves the division of cells and the reduction of the number of chromosomes.\n2. Spermatogonial stem cells: The germ cells then differentiate into spermatogonial stem cells, which are the precursors to sperm cells. These stem cells are found in the testicular tissue and are responsible for maintaining the pool of sperm cells throughout a male's reproductive life.\n3. Spermatocytes: As the spermatogonial stem cells mature, they undergo meiosis and differentiate into spermatocytes. This stage is characterized by the formation of the primary spermatocytes, which are the immature sperm cells that will eventually become mature spermatozoa.\n4. Spermatid stage: During the spermatid stage, the primary spermatocytes undergo a series of cellular divisions, resulting in the formation of mature spermatozoa. At this stage, the sperm cells begin to take on their characteristic shape and acquire their ability to move.\n5. Capacitation: After the spermatid stage, the mature sperm cells undergo a process called capacitation, during which they become capable of fertilizing an egg cell. This process involves changes in the sperm cell's membrane and the acquisition of the ability to undergo the acrosome reaction, which is necessary for fertilization.\n6. Maturation: The final stage of spermatogenesis is maturation, during which the mature sperm cells are released from the testes and enter the epididymis, where they mature and are stored until they are ready to be ejaculated.\nIn summary, the final maturation of a sperm cell occurs in the testes through a complex series of cellular divisions and differentiation events,", "known": true}

The clutch is one or two eggs (rarely three or four) which are incubated by both sexes for about 31 days (range 26–35 days). Eggs are chalky white and weigh about 240 grams. When disturbed from the nest, parents may sometimes attempt to conceal the eggs by attempting to cover them with material from the edge of the nest. The eggshells are removed by the parents after the chicks hatch either by carrying away the fragments or by swallowing them. About 30% of all breeding pairs succeed in raising chicks in any year, and most of the successful pairs raise one or two chicks each, with brood sizes of three being rare. One survey in Australia found 60% of breeding pairs to have successfully fledged chicks. This high success rate is attributed to above-normal rainfall that year. The chicks are fed by the parents for the first few days, but are able to feed independently after that and follow their parents for food. When alarmed, the parent cranes use a low \"korr-rr\" call that signals chicks to freeze and lie still. Young birds stay with their parents until the subsequent breeding season.

Add that to the fact you are probably blowing onto your sweaty fingers or palm, the evaporation of the sweat makes you feel like its cooler."], "llama7b_without_search_answer": " When you breathe out with an open mouth, the air is warmer because the mouth is not able to constrict or restrict the flow of air as much as when you purse your lips. Here's why:\nWhen you breathe out with an open mouth, the air flows freely through the mouth and nasal cavities without any obstruction. As a result, the air is not cooled or condensed as much before being exhaled, so it remains relatively warm.\nOn the other hand, when you purse your lips, you are creating a small opening in the mouth that allows air to escape more slowly and quietly. This slower flow of air causes the air to cool and condense more quickly, making it feel colder when you exhale.\nThe reason for this difference in temperature has to do with the way the body regulates its temperature. When you breathe in, the body takes in warm air and mixes it with the cooler air in the lungs. This helps to maintain a stable body temperature. When you breathe out, the body wants to get rid of any excess heat, so it cools the air before exhaling it. By purseing your lips, you are slowing down the flow of air and allowing it to cool more quickly, which makes it feel colder.\nIt's worth noting that the temperature difference between breathing out with an open mouth versus pursed lips can be quite subtle, and may not always be noticeable. However, in general, the air will tend to feel warmer when you breathe out with an open mouth and colder when you purse your lips.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.1423948220064725, "rouge2": 0.01954397394136808, "rougeL": 0.09708737864077668, "rougeLsum": 0.11650485436893204}, "known": false}

The device has a hidden screw mechanism that moves the aluminum powder around to create the illusion of erasing and redrawing the image. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:\n1. The Etch A Sketch has a glass screen with a thin layer of aluminum powder applied to it. The aluminum powder is evenly distributed across the screen, creating a smooth surface.\n2. The stylus is used to scratch the aluminum powder on the screen, creating a line or shape. The stylus is made of a hard, flat material that can easily scratch the aluminum powder.\n3. As the stylus is moved across the screen, it pushes the aluminum powder around, creating a pattern of lines and shapes. The amount of aluminum powder that is pushed around depends on the pressure and speed of the stylus.\n4. The glass screen is mounted on a hidden screw mechanism that moves it back and forth as the stylus is used. This movement causes the aluminum powder to shift beneath the stylus, creating the illusion of erasing and redrawing the image.\n5. When the user wants to erase an area of the drawing, they simply shake the Etch A Sketch. This causes the aluminum powder to shift back to its original position, effectively erasing the lines and shapes that were created.\n6. To redraw an area, the user simply uses the stylus to scratch the aluminum powder again, creating new lines and shapes.\n7. The aluminum powder is not actually erased from the screen; instead, it is simply pushed back into place as the screen moves. This means that the image can be redrawn multiple times without actually erasing the original lines and shapes.\nOverall, the Etch A Sketch works by using a combination of friction and movement to create the illusion of erasing and redrawing an image. The aluminum powder is the key component that allows the user to create and manipulate the image, while the hidden screw mechanism helps to create the illusion of erasure and redrawing.", "rouge": {"rouge1": 0.17061611374407581, "rouge2": 0.05238095238095238, "rougeL": 0.14218009478672985, "rougeLsum": 0.14691943127962087}, "known": true}

The GI tract is a long, complex system that includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Here's how absorption is accomplished in each part of the GI tract:\n1. Mouth: The mouth is the first part of the GI tract to come into contact with food. The mouth secretes saliva, which contains enzymes that begin to break down carbohydrates into simpler sugars. However, most nutrient absorption occurs in the small intestine, so the mouth plays a relatively minor role in this process.\n2. Esophagus: The esophagus is a muscular tube that propels food from the mouth to the stomach. Food passes through the esophagus in a coordinated manner, thanks to the rhythmic contractions of the esophageal muscles.\n3. Stomach: The stomach is a sac-like organ that secretes digestive enzymes and acids to break down food. The stomach's acidic environment helps to denature proteins and break them down into smaller peptides and amino acids. The stomach also secretes mucus to protect itself from the acidic environment.\n4. Small intestine: The small intestine is the primary site of nutrient absorption. It is here that most of the nutrients from the food we eat are absorbed into the bloodstream. The walls of the small intestine are highly folded, increasing its surface area, allowing for more efficient absorption. The small intestine is lined with finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area even further. Enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver also help to break down food into smaller molecules, making it easier for absorption to occur.\n5. Large intestine: The large intestine, also known as the colon, is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from the waste material that enters it from the small intestine. The large intestine also houses a diverse community of microorganisms,", "known": false}
